# Publishing `openlore` to npm

OpenLore uses **npm Trusted Publishing** (OIDC) so the package is published from CI with no long-lived npm token in any secret store, shell, or laptop. Every published version carries a signed [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) attestation linking it to the exact GitHub Actions run that built it.

The CI workflow that does the publish lives at [.github/workflows/release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml) and fires automatically when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed (it also still fires if you publish a GitHub Release by hand).

## How a release happens

1. Bump the version locally: `npm version <patch|minor|major>` (this creates a `vX.Y.Z` tag).
2. `git push --follow-tags` to push both the bump commit and the tag.
3. That's it. Pushing the tag triggers the `Release` workflow, which:
   - `validate` — verifies the tag is reachable from `main`, re-runs `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:run`, the dependency audit, and `build`, then packs and uploads the exact npm tarball from a job with no OIDC permission.
   - `create-release` — creates the GitHub Release for the tag from its `CHANGELOG.md` section, falling back to auto-generated notes (idempotent: skipped if a Release for that tag already exists). Created with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so it does **not** re-trigger the workflow.
   - `publish` — downloads and integrity-checks that tarball, then runs `npm publish <tarball> --ignore-scripts --provenance --access public`. It does not check out source, install dependencies, build, or run package lifecycle scripts. No token; the OIDC handshake with npm authenticates the run.

If the `npm-publish` environment has a required reviewer, the `publish` job pauses for a human approval click before it can mint the OIDC token.

### Alternative paths

- **Publish a GitHub Release by hand** (Releases → Draft a new release → pick the tag → Publish): the `create-release` job is skipped (the Release already exists) and `publish` runs.
- **Re-run a failed publish**: **Actions → Release → Run workflow** and pass the tag (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup (do this once, then never again)

### 1. Configure Trusted Publishing on npmjs.com

Sign in to npmjs.com as a maintainer of the `openlore` package, then:

- Visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/openlore/access
- Scroll to **Trusted Publisher** and click **Add Trusted Publisher**
- Select **GitHub Actions** as the provider
- Fill in:
  - **Organization or user**: `clay-good`
  - **Repository**: `OpenLore`
  - **Workflow filename**: `release.yml`
  - **Environment name**: `npm-publish` (must match the `environment:` block in `release.yml`)
- Save.

### 2. Create the `npm-publish` deployment environment on GitHub

- Repo → **Settings → Environments → New environment**
- Name: `npm-publish`
- (Optional but recommended) Add a **required reviewer** so every publish requires a human approval click before the workflow can mint an OIDC token.
- Restrict deployments to protected release tags under **Deployment branches and tags**. Also protect `v*` tag creation, update, and deletion with a repository ruleset; the workflow independently rejects a release commit that is not reachable from `main`.

### 3. Revoke any existing npm automation tokens

This is the whole point of the migration. From npmjs.com:

- **Account settings → Access Tokens**
- Find any token with publish/write scope on `openlore` (likely labeled something like "openlore-ci" or "automation").
- Click **Revoke**.

If GitHub repo secrets still contain `NPM_TOKEN`, delete that secret too (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → remove `NPM_TOKEN`). The workflow no longer references it.

## Verifying a published version

After a release fires, anyone can audit the provenance:

```sh
npm view openlore --json | jq '.dist.attestations'
```

The attestation includes the GitHub workflow file, the commit SHA, and the run ID — anyone reproducing those inputs can confirm the published tarball came from this repo.

## Why Trusted Publishing matters

Long-lived publish tokens are the supply-chain attacker's favorite target — they bypass 2FA, often live in CI secret stores indefinitely, and have been exploited by worms like Shai-Hulud. Trusted Publishing replaces the token with a short-lived OIDC token minted per-workflow-run, scoped to a specific repo + workflow file + environment. The workflow further limits exposure by keeping dependency installation, builds, and package scripts out of the OIDC-enabled job; that job receives only the already-built, integrity-checked tarball.

## Troubleshooting

- **`E401 You must be logged in to publish packages`** — npm's Trusted Publisher config doesn't match the workflow. Double-check the org/repo/workflow filename/environment on npmjs.com against what's in `release.yml`.
- **`Error: Resource not accessible by integration`** — the workflow is missing `id-token: write` permission. It's already set in `release.yml`; if you forked the workflow, copy that line.
- **Workflow fires but never runs the publish job** — check the `npm-publish` environment exists and is reachable from the branch/tag being published.
