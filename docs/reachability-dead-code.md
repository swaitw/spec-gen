# Reachability & Dead-Code Analysis

> Spec 20. Cross-language. Deterministic, offline, no API key.
> **Candidates, never deletion authority.**

`find_dead_code` answers three graph-reachability questions grep can't (it sees text, not reach)
and the model burns tokens guessing at:

- **"What code is unreachable / dead?"** — mark-and-sweep from roots; the unreached remainder.
- **"Is anything calling X?"** — reachability from every entry point.
- **"What becomes dead if I delete X?"** — the set reachable *only* through X.

Prior art is knip / ts-prune (mark-and-sweep from entry points) — but **TypeScript/JavaScript-only**.
This is the cross-language version over the unified tree-sitter graph (15+ languages).

## Read this first — honest limits

Static reachability **cannot see** dynamic entry points, framework magic (routes, DI, plugin
registries), reflection, or public API consumed *outside* the repo. All of these produce false
"dead" positives. So `find_dead_code`:

- treats **tests, imported symbols, route handlers, `main`, and files a config invokes** as roots,
- returns **confidence-tagged candidates with a reason**, never a verdict,
- and **never auto-deletes**.

Every response carries `soundness.posture: "candidates-not-authority"` and explicit caveats. Treat
it as a lead generator for a human/agent to verify — not a delete list.

### The blind spot is now named per answer, not per README

The paragraph above is a *standing* caveat: it cannot say which answer is affected. The analyzer now
records each construct the resolver cannot follow — a **dynamic-boundary site** — during the same
parse that builds the graph, so a conclusion can name the specific line that bounds it:

- a candidate with a site that can **name** it is capped at `low`, and the stated reason is
  `a computed member dispatch at src/cli/commands/doctor.ts:742 can reach this symbol without a
  graph edge` rather than only "dynamic language";
- the answer's `confidenceBoundary.knownUnknowable` carries a `dynamic-boundary` crossing listing
  the file, line and kind of every site inside the subgraph the answer traversed — bounded,
  deduplicated by kind and file, with the omitted count stated;
- `report_coverage_gaps` **withholds** its `also-dead` label for such a symbol (that label asserts
  the absence of any caller), and `verify_claim` resolves a `dead` or `safe-to-change` claim to
  `unverifiable` instead of `confirmed`.

Scope is computable, not repository-wide: a site qualifies a candidate only in the candidate's own
file or in a file whose transitive import closure can name it, in the candidate's own language, and
only for the kinds that can hide a *caller* (`reflective-invoke`, `computed-member`,
`container-resolution`). Sites outside that closure are left to the standing caveat above.

It is **disclosure only** — never resolution, and never the opposite conclusion. A boundary can
withhold a negative claim; it can never report a symbol as live, tested, or unsafe.

The statically provable subset is recovered as edges instead (`literalReflection` in
`docs/language-support.md`): a stable module-private dispatch table binds each entry by its same-file declaration, as
`synthesized` edges labeled `literal-reflective`. A construct that binds stops being a site; one that
does not stays a site with its refusal reason (`over-cap`, `unresolved-in-file-scope`, …), so recovery
shrinks the disclosed boundary without removing the disclosure. A `directResolvedOnly` answer ignores
those edges, so it folds the bound constructs back in as `synthesized-binding` sites and is
never less cautious than it was before the edges existed. A language
with no matcher records no site and is reported as *unsupported* by the capability registry, never as
containing no dynamic dispatch.

## How roots and confidence work

A node is a **root** (assumed live) if it is a test, is imported by name from another file, is a
detected HTTP route handler, is `main`-like, or lives in a file a config invokes. Reachability is a
forward BFS from those roots.

### Config-wired roots

Code that only configuration invokes has no importer, so without evidence it reads as orphaned
(change: `add-framework-entry-point-adapters`). Deterministic adapters read:

| Config | What counts as wiring |
|---|---|
| root `package.json` | `bin`, `main`, `module`, `exports` targets; files run by `scripts`; `jest` setup files |
| `tsconfig.json` | `files`; `outDir` → `rootDir` maps a build output (`dist/cli/index.js`) back to its source |
| `vitest`/`vite`/`jest` config | literal `setupFiles` / `globalSetup` values |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | files run by `run:` steps, relative to the step's `working-directory` |

A command wires a file only when it **executes** it: the script after a runner (`node`, `tsx`,
`python`, `bash`, …, past wrappers such as `cross-env` or `npx`), a `--require` / `--import` preload,
or a path in command position. A path passed as an argument (`eslint src/x.ts`), a redirect target
(`> dist/out.js`), or heredoc content is not wiring.

Every function in a wired file becomes an `externally-wired` root: the graph has no node for
module-scope code, so a wired file's load-time calls cannot be told from its helpers, and the bias
stays false-live over false-dead. The report counts them in `rootKinds.externallyWired` and lists each
wired file with its receipts (config file and key) in `externalWiring.files`.

A reference the adapters cannot resolve is listed in `externalWiring.boundaries` with a reason and
counted in a caveat, never guessed: `dynamic-reference` (a variable, `${{ }}` expression, or glob),
`unsupported-form` (a module run by name, a path after a `cd`, or a config with too many references),
`target-not-found`, `build-output-unmapped` (a build output tsconfig does not map to a source),
`outside-repository`, `unreadable-config` (a link, a non-regular file, or one over 1 MB), and
`unparsed-config`. Workspace-member manifests,
framework routing conventions, and other config formats are not read, and only POSIX shell
workflow steps are tokenized (a PowerShell or cmd step is an `unsupported-form` boundary). On this
repository, 36 of 1,018 entry points are in config-wired files.

Confidence is deliberately conservative — the bias is toward **false-live over false-dead**:

| Confidence | When |
|------------|------|
| `high` | static language · no internal caller · not imported by name · **and its module is not imported anywhere** |
| `medium` | reachable only from other dead code, or no dependency-graph signal available |
| `low` | dynamic language (Python/Ruby/PHP/…), **or its module is imported elsewhere** (namespace/default/re-export usage the named-import scan can't resolve), **or a dynamic-boundary site can name it** |

That last rule matters: on a real repo it cut high-confidence candidates from ~470 to ~35 — a
symbol living in a module something else imports is never flagged `high`, because the specific
usage may be a namespace or default import this static scan doesn't resolve.

### Re-export / barrel resolution raises recall (fewer false-dead)

A reachability conclusion is only as sound as the call graph is complete. The TS/JS import resolver
follows re-export chains — `export { x } from './impl'`, `export * from './x'` (and TypeScript's ESM
`.js` specifiers) — through any depth of barrel to a symbol's **true definition**, and that resolution
runs on every cross-file *call edge* (not just base classes). A call imported through a barrel resolves
to the real target (labelled `re_export`) instead of stalling at the barrel and falling through to the
ambiguous first-same-named-candidate (`name_only`). Concretely, dogfooding this repo moved **29 symbols
off the false-dead / false-entry-point list** — e.g. `EdgeStore.open` went from a reported *zero
callers* to its real 22 — because a method/static call through an imported receiver now binds to its
definition. See [openspec/changes/add-call-resolution-recall/](../openspec/changes/add-call-resolution-recall/).

## How it works

Pure read over the existing graph — **no schema change**:

- **Reachability** — forward BFS over [`buildAdjacency`](../src/core/services/mcp-handlers/graph.ts)'s
  forward map from the root set; candidate-dead = code nodes not reached. External and
  infrastructure (IaC) nodes are excluded.
- **Liveness signals** — tests + HTTP route handlers + `main` + config-wired files, plus the dependency graph's
  imported names (symbol-level) and imported files (module-level) for the cross-language
  "used elsewhere" signal.
- **Delete-impact** — recompute reachability with the target removed from both seeds and the
  graph, and diff against the baseline reached set.

Implementation: [`reachability.ts`](../src/core/services/mcp-handlers/reachability.ts). Tested over
a two-language fixture with known live regions, a dead orphan, a dead cluster, and a
delete-impact diff in
[`reachability.test.ts`](../src/core/services/mcp-handlers/reachability.test.ts).

> Accuracy depends on a current `analyze_codebase` that includes tests and produces the dependency

> confidence is reduced and the response says so.

> **Index integrity.** When the persisted index does not reconcile against its build-time attestation —
> materially smaller than the build committed (`degraded`) or built at a different schema (`mismatched`) —
> the response carries that verdict in `confidenceBoundary.integrity` and is not marked `complete`. A
> "dead" conclusion over a half-built index is the most dangerous false negative, so "looks dead to a
