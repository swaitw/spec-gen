/**
 * `openloreHealth` — functional readiness as a value (change: extend-api-for-supervising-hosts).
 *
 * A supervising host must never report "ready" because a process is alive. The distinctions it
 * needs — runtime available, index present and whole, watcher healthy, background repair running —
 * are ones OpenLore already draws internally; today a host assembles them by parsing the daemon's
 * `/health` payload and inferring the rest from the shape of an analyze result. That is inference
 * where a fact would do, and it couples the host to a transport payload rather than a contract.
 *
 * DISK IS THE BASE CASE, NOT A FALLBACK. Index state, degradations and repair-in-progress are read
 * from disk, so the answer is meaningful with no daemon at all: a repository with a whole index and
 * nothing running is `ready`, never `unavailable`. A discoverable daemon only REFINES the answer,
 * by supplying the one fact disk cannot hold — whether the freshness watcher is running.
