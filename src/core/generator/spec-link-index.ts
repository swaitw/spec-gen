/**
 * Deterministic spec link index.
 *
 * Replaces the LLM-pipeline-owned requirement mapping with a pure function of
 * (existing specs, current analysis graph). Every link comes from an anchor a
 * human or agent wrote explicitly in the spec — never from name similarity,
 * embeddings, or an LLM. That makes coverage an OBSERVATION rather than an
 * inference, and makes Repair usable without a prior probabilistic Generate run.
 *
 * Resolution is intentionally conservative (change `harden-spec-workflow-lifecycle`,
 * decision 671084e7):
 *
 *   - exact anchor resolving to exactly one graph identity → `linked`
 *   - anchor resolving to several exact identities         → `ambiguous`
 *   - anchor naming an exported TYPE (not behaviour)       → `type-only`
 *   - anchor whose identity is absent from the graph       → `stale`
 *   - absent identity in a file the analysis cannot vouch for → `not-assessed`
 *   - requirement with no exact symbol anchor at all       → `unmapped`
 *
 * A file-only anchor contributes to the domain FOOTPRINT and never to function
 * coverage: citing `src/auth/session.ts` does not make every function in that
 * file covered.
 *
 * This module is pure and does no I/O so it can be exercised directly by unit
 * fixtures; callers supply already-read spec content and the cached graph.

 *       `stale`: the type exists, it is merely outside what coverage measures
 *   7 — an absent identity in a file whose exports the analysis cannot vouch for is
 *       `not-assessed` instead of `stale` (change: ground-generated-specs-in-the-graph)
