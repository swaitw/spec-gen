/**
 * Atomic analysis-generation identity.
 *
 * Analysis artifacts were written individually and daemon caches keyed primarily
 * on artifact mtime, so a multi-artifact reader could observe a MIXTURE of an old
 * and a new analysis — one file from before a rebuild, another from after. Each
 * full analysis now publishes a generation manifest binding every required
 * artifact to one identity and content digest, and readers validate that identity
 * before AND after a multi-artifact read (change `harden-spec-workflow-lifecycle`,
 * decision 64e6eb87).
 *
 * The manifest is what makes a generation CURRENT: it is written last, after
 * every required artifact is durable. Writers serialize the complete required
 * write set and this commit point under the analysis lock. Readers that do not
 * participate in that lock still verify content digests and refuse a mixture.
 *
 * Renaming the whole analysis directory was rejected — databases, runtime
 * sidecars, and platform-specific rename behavior make whole-directory
 * replacement unnecessarily risky for the guarantee actually needed, which is
 * that a reader never ACCEPTS a mixture.
