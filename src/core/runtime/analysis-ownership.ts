/**
 * Repository-scoped full-analysis ownership.
 *
 * Only one full analysis may own a repository at a time. Duplicate analyses were
 * observed across distinct processes and frontends (CLI, MCP, daemon bootstrap,
 * Pi), so process-local promise deduplication cannot fix them — the guarantee has
 * to be cross-process (change `harden-spec-workflow-lifecycle`, decision 4da0a04f).
 *
 * This is one thin binding of the repository's single advisory-lock loop,
 * not a second locking mechanism. It supplies policy values and nothing else: a
 * structured JSON payload, a dead-PID-plus-stale-heartbeat staleness predicate,
 * `report` contention, `bestEffortAfterMaxWait: false`, and — under `--wait` — an
 * unbounded wait, since an attach ends when the owner finishes or dies.
 *
 * Ownership cannot simply reuse `acquireAnalysisLock`: it uses a different path,
 * reports its structured holder to attach-capable callers, and spans the whole
 * analysis run rather than only the publication write set. Both bindings fail
 * closed and wait indefinitely when their correctness guarantee requires it.
 *
 * Runtime lock and progress state deliberately live OUTSIDE the analysis
 * artifacts: heartbeat timestamps are not deterministic evidence and must never
 * enter an artifact digest.
