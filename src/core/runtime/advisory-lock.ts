/**
 * The repository's ONE cross-process advisory-lock loop.
 *
 * Four callers share it — JSON-store commit sections, decision consolidation,
 * analysis-artifact writers, and full-analysis ownership. All are thin bindings of `acquireLockAt`; there
 * is no second locking mechanism and no second stale-steal or release path.
 *
 * Decisions: `record_decision` spawns a detached `decisions --consolidate` per
 * call. Under rapid recording, several consolidations run at once; each does a
 * load → mutate → save of `pending.json`, and the later save clobbers the
 * earlier one — silently losing decisions (observed during the spec-15 dogfood:
 * 5 rapid records produced 3 stored decisions). Serializing consolidation behind
 * this lock — and reloading the store *inside* it — makes the read-modify-write
 * safe: whoever holds the lock sees every draft written so far, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * Analysis artifacts: a running watcher's read-patch-write of the JSON artifact
 * set and a full `analyze` (including the watcher's own self-heal spawn) can
 * overlap on the same files. The same lock shape — keyed on the analysis output
 * directory — serializes the two artifact-write critical sections so the final
 * on-disk set is one writer's complete output, never an interleaving.
 *
 * Analysis ownership (change `harden-spec-workflow-lifecycle`, decision 4da0a04f):
 * duplicate full analyses were observed across distinct processes and frontends,
 * so ownership needs the same primitive with a different POLICY — a structured
 * payload, a dead-PID-plus-stale-heartbeat staleness predicate, contention that
 * REPORTS instead of waiting, and no best-effort escape (proceeding unlocked
 * would void the single-flight guarantee). Those four differences are parameters
 * of this loop, not a second implementation.
 *
 * Ownership and the artifact lock are complementary: ownership spans a whole
 * analysis run, while `.artifacts.lock` fences only the artifact write-set and is
 * also taken by the incremental watcher, which never takes ownership. An owner
 * acquires ownership BEFORE the artifact lock and never the reverse — one fixed
 * order, so the two can never deadlock.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LOCK GUARANTEES, AND WHERE IT STOPS
 *
 * It is ADVISORY. It serializes cooperating writers that all take it; it does not
 * constrain a process that ignores it, and it is not a security boundary.
 *
 * Taking the lock (`open` with `wx`) and stealing a stale one (`rename`) are atomic
 * namespace operations. Acquire, steal, and release all pass through a short-lived
 * namespace gate. Release compares the path inode with the acquired inode while
 * holding that gate, then unlinks only its own file. A stale or misconfigured
 * holder therefore cannot delete a successor.
 *
 * Reclamation is therefore deliberately conservative: a lock is stolen only when
 * its holder is confirmed dead and old enough to exclude an acquire still writing
 * its payload. Ambiguous, malformed, and PID-reused locks fail closed. They may
 * require operator cleanup, but they never authorize two correctness-sensitive
 * writers at once.
