/**
 * One loaded traversal structure per artifact generation
 * (change: optimize-reachability-precompute).
 *
 * The handlers used to rebuild `Map<string, Set<string>>` adjacency on every tool
 * call. They now ask this module for the shared {@link TraversalIndex} instead.
 *
 * INVALIDATION rides entirely on object identity, so it cannot drift: the memo is
 * a `WeakMap` keyed on the `SerializedCallGraph` object itself. `readCachedContext`
 * hands out one context object per `llm-context.json` generation and replaces it
 * wholesale when the file's mtime moves — so a new generation is a new `callGraph`
 * object, which is a memo miss, which reloads. An externally-run `openlore analyze`
 * that rewrites the artifact under a warm daemon therefore cannot be answered from
 * the old structure; there is no cached-generation bookkeeping to get wrong, and a
 * garbage-collected context takes its structure with it.
 *
 * The persisted artifact is an optimization on top of that, never a source of
 * truth. Anything it cannot prove about itself — absent, oversized, stale-digest,
 * truncated, altered in its own bytes, addressing outside its own arrays, written
 * by another schema version, byte-ordered for another host — falls back to building
 * the structure in memory. A slower correct answer always wins.
 *
 * TRUST BOUNDARY, stated plainly. Two different properties, deliberately not
 * conflated:
 *  - CORRUPTION is caught. `graphDigest` proves the structure belongs to the
 *    graph being served, `payloadDigest` proves its own bytes are intact, and the
 *    bounds checks prove no index escapes the array it addresses. Bitrot, a partial
 *    write, and a careless hand edit are all refused, not answered.
 *  - FORGERY is not, and cannot be here. A writer that recomputes both digests
 *    could serve a structure that lies about the graph. But that writer already has
 *    write access to `.openlore/analysis/`, where `llm-context.json` — the graph
 *    itself — sits beside it and is exactly as forgeable. This artifact adds no new
 *    trust surface: it is trusted precisely as far as the graph artifact is, never
 *    further, and verifying it against the graph would cost the O(N+E) rebuild it
 *    exists to avoid while buying nothing an attacker could not get by editing the
 *    graph directly.
