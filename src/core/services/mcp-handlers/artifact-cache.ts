/**
 * Stamp-keyed caches for the analysis artifacts a serving process reads repeatedly.
 *
 * The artifacts under `.openlore/analysis/` are written by OTHER processes —
 * `openlore analyze`, `openlore generate`, the watcher's own flush. A cache keyed on
 * the project directory alone therefore goes stale silently and stays stale for the
 * whole lifetime of a daemon. Every cache here keys on an identity stamp of the file
 * it holds, so an external rewrite is picked up on the next read and an unchanged
 * artifact is parsed exactly once.
 *
 * These artifacts are also untrusted repository content, and a cache makes that
 * sharper: what is parsed here is RETAINED. Reads therefore follow the same rules as
 * the repo's other untrusted-artifact readers (`readCorpusSidecarBounded`,
 * `readFileConfinedWithStat`) — no symlink following, regular files only, a byte
 * ceiling enforced on the READ rather than on a prior stat, and an identity check
 * taken from the same descriptor that produced the bytes.
 *
 * Deliberately its own module rather than part of `utils.ts`: `utils.ts` is mocked
 * wholesale by most handler tests, and a shared read path should not depend on every
 * one of those mocks listing it.
 *
 * Callers pass an absolute path they have already confined to a validated project
 * directory (every current one builds it as `join(await validateDirectory(dir),
 * '.openlore', 'analysis', …)`). This module does not re-derive that confinement; it
 * defends the read itself.
 *
