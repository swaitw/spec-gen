/**
 * Dynamic-boundary surfacing (change: disclose-dynamic-boundary-regions).
 *
 * The analyzer records, per file, every dispatch construct the resolver cannot follow. This module
 * is the read side shared by every conclusion whose soundness rests on reachability completeness:
 * given the files a conclusion actually traversed, it produces ONE structured
 * `known-unknowable` crossing naming the sites in scope — so the answer says *which* construct
 * bounds it, instead of the whole-README caveat that "dynamic dispatch is not captured".
 *
 * Three scoping rules keep the disclosure useful rather than fatiguing:
 *
 *  1. **Scoped to the traversal, never the repository.** A conclusion over a clean subgraph in a
 *     repository full of reflection discloses nothing. A repository-wide list would be the blanket
 *     caveat it replaces.
 *  2. **Bounded, with a receipt.** Deduplicated by kind+file, capped, and the omitted count is
 *     stated — a bounded list must never read as the whole set.
 *  3. **One-directional.** A boundary can qualify a NEGATIVE conclusion (dead, untested, safe). It
 *     can never promote a symbol to live, tested, or unsafe: an unknown is not evidence.
 *
 * A repository with no site has no artifact, so every helper here fails open to "no boundary" and
 * a clean repository pays one failed `readFile` per conclusion — and, once the report is absent,
 * nothing else.
