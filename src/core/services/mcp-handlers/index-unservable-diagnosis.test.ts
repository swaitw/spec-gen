/**
 * An unservable index must say WHY, not report absence.
 *
 * `readCachedContext` already distinguishes these cases — it emits a different telemetry
 * `reason` for each — and then returns a bare `null`, so every caller collapsed them into
 * "No analysis found. Run analyze_codebase first."
 *
 * That message is correct for exactly one of them. For the others it reports a FAILED
 * INTEGRITY CHECK as a missing index, which is the quiet downgrade `loadPartialFirstRun`'s
 * own docstring says this lane exists to prevent — and it hides the incident: a user reads
 * "no analysis", runs analyze, it works, and a lost publish is never reported.
 *
 * The generation-mismatch case here is not hypothetical. It was observed on a real
 * repository: artifacts rewritten at 23:36 against a manifest published at 23:33, four of
 * five recorded hashes no longer matching, no writer running, and every tool call answering
 * "No analysis found" for five minutes.
 *
 * A diagnosis that mislabels is worse than no diagnosis, so three of the cases below pin the
 * situations where the naive form of this check would confidently say the wrong thing: a
 * symlinked artifact (which the reader refuses but a path-following `stat` cannot see), a
 * healthy in-flight publish (whose sentinel manifest reads as "unavailable" BY DESIGN), and
 * the ordinary mid-write window (whose mismatch is expected, not an incident).
