/**
 * Background index repair service (changes: add-zero-interaction-onboarding →
 * make-index-self-healing).
 *
 * Originally the cold-start self-bootstrap: if an agent wired the OpenLore MCP
 * server but never ran `openlore install`, the very first session had no index
 * and every tool returned "run analyze first." That warmed an ABSENT index once,
 * in the background.
 *
 * `make-index-self-healing` generalizes it: every read-path staleness signal that
 * today only produces a warning (integrity `mismatched`, an over-threshold stale
 * region, a schema reset, an aged analysis) now triggers the SAME at-most-once,
 * non-blocking background rebuild — so detection finally closes the loop into
 * repair instead of stopping at disclosure.
 *
 * Guarantees (unchanged from the bootstrap it grew out of):
 *   - AT MOST ONCE per process per repo. A completed repair that still observes
 *     its trigger discloses and stops — it never loops or thrashes. The guard is
 *     cleared only on FAILURE, so a transient build error can retry.
 *   - NEVER blocks the caller: the build runs detached from the call path; reads
 *     during it are served from the stale index with an honest "refresh started"
 *     disclosure, never held.
 *   - NEVER throws: a build failure leaves the graceful guidance in place.
 *   - Opt-out via `OPENLORE_NO_AUTO_ANALYZE` or `.openlore/config.json` `autoInit:false`.
 *
 * Deterministic, no LLM, no new dependency.
