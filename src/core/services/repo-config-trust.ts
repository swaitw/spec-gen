/**
 * Trust boundary for network settings read out of `.openlore/config.json`.
 *
 * That file is committed IN the repository being analyzed, so on a cloned repo it is
 * attacker-authored — the same premise `safeOpenspecDir` already acts on for
 * `openspecPath`. Two of its fields decide where an OPERATOR credential goes and
 * whether the connection carrying it is verified:
 *
 *   - `llm.apiBase` — the provider endpoint. Anthropic requests carry the victim's
 *     `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in an `x-api-key` header, OpenAI's carry `OPENAI_API_KEY`
 *     as a bearer token. A repo that sets `apiBase` to a host it controls collects
 *     that key on the victim's next `openlore generate` / `drift` — or on their next
 *     commit, since the decisions gate runs consolidation from the pre-commit hook.
 *   - `llm.sslVerify: false` — turns off certificate verification, which is what
 *     makes the redirect survivable for an on-path attacker as well.
 *
 * The rule this module enforces: repo data may not choose where operator credentials
 * go, nor waive the verification protecting them. An operator can still do both — via
 * `--api-base` / `--insecure` or the provider env vars, all of which come from the
 * person running the command rather than from the clone.
 *
 * A loopback `apiBase` is exempt: pointing at a local proxy (ollama, LiteLLM, a
 * recording proxy) is the legitimate reason to commit the field at all, and a
 * loopback address cannot exfiltrate to an attacker's host.
 *
 * That last clause depends on one thing outside this module: every credentialed fetch
 * must set `redirect: 'error'`. A loopback listener (a hostile repo can ship a dev script
 * that binds the port) is otherwise a one-hop redirector — the fetch spec strips only
 * Authorization, Cookie and Proxy-Authorization across origins, so `x-api-key` /
 * `x-goog-api-key` survive and a 307/308 replays the body. `outbound-redirect-guard.test.ts`
 * holds that side of the boundary.
 *
 * `generation.openaiCompatBaseUrl` follows the same rule. A remote compatibility
 * gateway must be selected by the operator through an option or environment variable;
 * a committed repository value is accepted only for loopback development servers.
