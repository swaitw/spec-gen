/**
 * Issue #451 — a debounced flush must never skip SILENTLY.
 *
 * The reported symptom was an incremental flush that intermittently never landed
 * on Windows: `llm-context.json` still held the seeded empty context and nothing
 * anywhere said why. Three separate holes in this lane produce exactly that
 * observable, and each is a real product defect in a long-lived MCP server, not a
 * test artifact — a watcher that drops a file event without a signal leaves the
 * index stale and the agent unaware:
 *
 *   1. `handleBatch` treated EVERY read failure as "the file was deleted" and,
 *      when that emptied the batch, returned writing nothing and saying nothing.
 *   2. `flush` drains `pending` before its first await, and only two error
 *      classes put the paths back — every other failure lost them permanently,
 *      contradicting `flushBatchWithBusyRetry`'s own docstring.
 *   3. `stop`'s shutdown drain lost its batch the same way, and then reported a
 *      clean stop because its "still deferred" check read the emptied queue.
 *
 * Plus a fourth, found while auditing the state machine: a `.git` write with no
 * indexable file change latched the VCS settle window forever, after which the
 * hard batch ceiling could never be re-armed.
 *
 * These tests inject the failures deterministically. The Windows trigger itself
 * (a sharing violation making `readFileConfined`'s descriptor-identity check fail
 * closed) is not reproducible here — the DURABILITY contract is.
