/**
 * Scoped TLS relaxation for `--insecure` / `skipSslVerify`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Disabling certificate verification used to be done by setting
 * `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0'` at start-up and leaving it set. That is
 * process-global and permanent: from the first LLM call onward, EVERY https
 * connection in the process was unverified — the update check, a git helper, any
 * later request — not just the endpoint the user opted out for. In the long-lived
 * `openlore mcp` daemon that meant the rest of the session.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DONE THIS WAY
 * Node's built-in `fetch` accepts no per-request TLS options, and an `Agent` from
 * the npm `undici` package is rejected by it (`UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG`) because the
 * built-in fetch is a separate undici instance. Verified on Node 25. So the env var
 * is still the only lever available without either adding `undici` as a dependency
 * AND switching these call sites to its `fetch` export, or rewriting them onto
 * `https.request`. Both are real options; see the note at the bottom.
 *
 * What changed is the LIFETIME. The variable is now set immediately before a
 * request and restored immediately after, which is safe because:
 *   - certificate verification happens during the TLS handshake, inside `fetch()`,
 *     so restoring once `fetch()` resolves does not affect an in-flight body — a
 *     streamed response continues to read fine afterwards, and
 *   - deleting the variable genuinely re-enables verification; Node does not cache
 *     the previous value.
 * Both behaviours are asserted in `tls-scope.test.ts` rather than assumed.
 *
 * REMAINING EXPOSURE, stated plainly: the variable is still process-global while a
 * scope is open. An unrelated https request that happens to be in flight during
 * that window is also unverified. The window is now one request rather than the
 * process lifetime, which is a large reduction but not elimination. Eliminating it
 * requires per-request TLS options, i.e. one of the two migrations above.
 *
 * CHILD PROCESSES were the worst part of that exposure, and are closed. A child
 * spawned while a scope is open inherits `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for its
 * WHOLE LIFETIME — not for one request — so a background index build or a detached
 * consolidation started in that window ran entirely unverified. Spawn sites pass
 * `childEnvWithoutScopedTlsRelaxation()` so the child sees the operator's own value
 * instead of this module's temporary one.

/**
 * The operator's TLS opt-out, read from the environment.
 *
 * WHY AN ENV VAR AT ALL, given `--insecure` already exists: `--insecure` is a CLI
 * flag, and the paths that most often face an internal self-signed endpoint never
 * see a command line — the long-lived `openlore mcp` daemon, and the decisions gate
 * spawned by the git pre-commit hook. Those had NO operator lever for the LLM path;
 * embeddings had one (`EMBED_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY`) and the LLM did not.
 *
 * WHY EVERY KEY IS SURFACE-SCOPED, and there is deliberately NO global one: needing
 * to relax verification for one surface and not the other is the ordinary case — an
 * internal self-signed embedding server alongside an LLM vendor with a perfectly
 * valid certificate. A single switch would force the operator to relax BOTH to fix
 * one, a strictly larger exposure than the problem requires, and it would be the
 * broadest ambient lever in the codebase while an `openlore mcp` daemon is running.
 * The case it would serve — every outbound endpoint behind one internal CA — is
 * exactly what `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` handles properly, by making the certificates
 * VERIFY rather than skipping the check. So two scoped keys, and no union:
 *
 *   - `EMBED_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY` — embedding requests only
 *   - `LLM_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY`   — LLM provider requests only
 *
 * The trust boundary is unchanged: this reads the OPERATOR's environment, never the
 * analyzed repository's `.openlore/config.json` (see `repo-config-trust.ts`). A clone
 * still cannot disable verification on the machine analyzing it.
 *
 * Prefer `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` over either key wherever the signing CA is available.
