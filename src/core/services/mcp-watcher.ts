/**
 * McpWatcher — incremental re-indexer for the MCP server's --watch mode.
 *
 * Watches source files for changes and incrementally updates:
 *   1. signatures in llm-context.json (always)
 *   2. vector index (only when embed: true and an embedding server is reachable)
 *
 * The call graph is deliberately excluded — rebuilding it requires full
 * tree-sitter analysis of all call sites and is too expensive for a watch loop.
 * It stays current via the post-commit hook (openlore analyze --force --embed).
 *
 * Spec 13.1 (watch-mode performance): freshness is O(change), not O(repo).
 *   • Per-file events COALESCE into one batched flush (single debounce timer +
 *     hard max-batch ceiling), so a burst / branch-switch runs the pipeline once,
 *     not once per file.
 *   • The patched llm-context is handed to the MCP read cache in place
 *     (primeContextCache), so the next tool call is a cache HIT — no 2.1 MB
 *     cold re-parse — even after the disk write.
 *   • Vector updates are row-level (VectorIndex.updateFiles), not a full-corpus
 *     read+overwrite, and run on a separate lower-priority lane so signature
 *     freshness never blocks on embedding.
 *   • VCS-flood / bulk batches are detected and collapsed to a single refresh.
 *   • stderr emits one summary line per batch by default (per-file detail behind
 *     OPENLORE_WATCH_DEBUG).
