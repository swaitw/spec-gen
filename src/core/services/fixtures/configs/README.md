# Frozen configuration compatibility fixtures

These files are immutable evidence of configuration shapes accepted by published OpenLore releases.
They intentionally do not move with the current schema.

- `2.0.0-default.json` captures the configuration factory shape from tag `v2.0.0`.
- `2.1.9-customized.json` captures the customized pre-2.2 shape reported in issue #386, including a
  missing `generation.domains` field that was accepted before strict validation.
- `2.2.0-default.json` captures the configuration factory shape from tag `v2.2.0`.
- `3.0.0-default.json` captures the configuration factory shape for the v3 release candidate.
- `3.0.1-default.json` captures the unchanged configuration factory shape for the v3.0.1
  release-pipeline patch.
- `3.1.0-default.json` captures the default configuration factory shape for v3.1.0 and schema 1.2.0.
- `3.1.0-workspace.json` captures the optional workspace-shard and retrieval settings introduced in
  v3.1.0.
- `3.1.1-default.json` captures the unchanged default configuration factory shape for v3.1.1 and
  schema 1.2.0.
- `3.2.0-default.json` captures the unchanged default configuration factory shape for v3.2.0 and
  schema 1.2.0.
- `3.3.0-default.json` captures the unchanged default configuration factory shape for v3.3.0 and
  schema 1.2.0. `3.3.0-pi-all.json` captures the explicit Pi all-tools option.

For each release, add at least one `<package-version>-*.json` fixture before changing the package
version. Include both a factory-default shape and a realistic customized shape when the release
changes configuration behavior. Never regenerate or edit an older fixture; add an explicit migration
when a frozen fixture stops loading.
