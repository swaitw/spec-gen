/**
 * Symbol-level changed-sets between a base revision and the working tree
 * (change: add-symbol-content-hashes).
 *
 * `blast_radius`, `select_tests` and `briefing_since` used to seed from every production symbol in
 * every changed file. This module narrows that to the symbols that actually changed. Each changed
 * file is extracted twice with normalized content hashes, once at the base revision and once from the
 * working tree, and the two hash sets are compared: a symbol is `changed` when its hash differs,
 * `appeared` or `disappeared` when it exists on one side only. Only the files the diff names are ever
 * read, so the cost is bounded by the diff and never by the repository.
 *
 * Narrowing must never drop a symbol that file-level seeding would have caught for a reason that
 * still holds. A file therefore stays FILE-granular, with a named reason, whenever the evidence is
 * incomplete:
 *
 *  - either side could not be read, parsed cleanly, or hashed (`unreadable`, `parse-errors`,
 *    `language-not-hashed`, `span-not-contiguous`, `invalid-span`);
 *  - anything outside every symbol changed: an import, a module-level constant, a class field, or
 *    the order of the symbols (`module-level-change`);
 *  - module-level code NAMES a changed symbol, so it may bind it (`module-level-reference`);
 *  - the index does not match what the working tree extracts to (`index-mismatch`);
 *  - a bound is spent: files, per-file bytes, total bytes, or wall clock (`file-cap`, `size-cap`,
 *    `time-cap`) — every one of which keeps all of that file's symbols seeded;
 *  - the changed-set could not assess the file at all (`not-assessed`).
 *
 * Inside a symbol-granular file, two more groups stay seeded because a same-file caller can reach a
 * changed symbol without a resolved edge: symbols whose text names a changed symbol (`referencing`),
 * and symbols that hold a dynamic-dispatch site (`dynamicDispatch`). Cross-file effects are no worse
 * than file-level seeding, which never seeded other files either.
 *
 * A disappeared/appeared pair that symbol-identity continuity (`analyzer/continuity.ts`) matches is
 * also reported as a carried rename or move. Both ids stay in the seed set — which seeds nothing at
 * all when the index holds neither path yet, and the receipt says so through `changedSymbolsNotIndexed`
 * rather than letting the caller read the silence as "unchanged".
