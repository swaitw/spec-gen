/**
 * Every outbound HTTPS request must go through `withRelaxedTls`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A CONVENTION
 * When TLS relaxation moved from "set an env var once at start-up" to "relax around
 * each request", the set of `fetch` calls that needed wrapping became something a
 * person has to remember. That failed twice while writing the change itself:
 * `doctor.ts` opted in and never wrapped (so its probe would have started FAILING for
 * exactly the users who configured `skipSslVerify`), and `view.ts`'s model listing
 * silently lost the relaxation it used to inherit from the global variable.
 *
 * Neither broke a test, because nothing in the suite probes a self-signed endpoint
 * through those paths. A reviewer would have had to notice an absence. So the rule is
 * enforced here instead: add an https-capable `fetch` without wrapping it, and this
 * fails with the file and line.
 *
 * The failure mode being prevented is quiet and one-directional — the request simply
 * starts rejecting certificates the user chose to accept, in a code path most CI
 * never exercises.

 * Calls that cannot involve TLS, with the reason each is exempt.

 * Only loopback HTTP to OpenLore's own daemon qualifies: `serve-client` builds
 * `http://<host>:<port>` from the serve descriptor, and the Pi extension talks to
 * that same daemon. There is no certificate to verify, so wrapping would be noise.
 *
 * `pi/extension.ts` `fetchModels` is listed for a different reason and is NOT an
 * endorsement: the Pi host never calls `allowInsecureTls`, so its provider probe has
 * never honoured `skipSslVerify` — before or after the scoping change. Wrapping it
 * alone would change nothing; making it work needs the Pi host to read the config and
 * opt in, which is a behaviour change in its own right.
