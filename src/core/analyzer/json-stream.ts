/**
 * Streaming, atomic JSON artifact writer (change: bulletproof-background-index).
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` must materialize its entire result as one JavaScript string, and V8 caps a
 * string at 536,870,888 characters. Past that it throws `RangeError: Invalid string length` — a
 * hard ceiling, not memory pressure, so a bigger `--max-old-space-size` cannot move it.
 *
 * Analyze wrote its two whole-repository artifacts (`llm-context.json`, `dependency-graph.json`)
 * with an unguarded `JSON.stringify`, and the throw propagates to analyze's top-level catch. The
 * user-visible result on a large repository is the worst possible shape: every file parsed, every
 * pass run — potentially hours — and then `[error] Analysis failed: Invalid string length`, exit 1,
 * nothing written, and a message that names neither the cause nor a remedy.
 *
 * How close is real code? Measured on OpenLore's own source, `llm-context.json` is ~3,842
 * characters per indexed function, which puts the ceiling at roughly 140,000 functions.
 * microsoft/TypeScript indexes 152,046. This is reachable by ordinary large repositories, and the
 * amplification is per-symbol rather than per-byte, so a function-dense repository gets there well
 * below TypeScript's size on disk.
 *
 * This writer emits the same bytes without ever holding them all at once, and returns the SHA-256
 * of what it wrote so a caller can fingerprint the artifact without re-reading it.
 *
 * The output is byte-identical to `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)`. That is load-bearing for
 * artifact reproducibility: two analyze runs over the same inputs must produce byte-identical
 * output (see the determinism e2e), so a single differing space would break that guarantee. It
 * comes from delegating: any subtree the writer
 * chooses not to split is serialized by `JSON.stringify` itself and re-indented, so every leaf rule
 * — `toJSON`, omitted `undefined` object values, `null` for `undefined` array holes, `NaN` as
 * `null`, key escaping — is inherited rather than reimplemented. Which subtrees get split is purely
 * a memory decision and cannot affect the output; `json-stream.test.ts` checks that against
 * `JSON.stringify` directly, including at a split threshold low enough to split nearly everything.
