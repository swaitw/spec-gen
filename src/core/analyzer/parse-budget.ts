/**
 * Per-file parse budget (change: fix-analyze-native-abort-and-file-cost-budget).
 *
 * Extraction of one file used to be unbounded in wall-clock time. Measured on a 300 KB file of
 * a repeated unterminated block-comment opener: 84 s inside `parser.parse()` alone, yielding a
 * 100,002-deep tree. A minified bundle or a generated client in an ordinary repository reaches
 * the same path, so this is not only a hostile-input problem.
 *
 * ## Why the bound is in-band, not a timer
 *
 * `parser.parse()` is one synchronous call into a native binding. A `setTimeout` cannot preempt
 * it — the event loop does not run until it returns — and terminating the worker that holds it
 * is precisely what turns a slow parse into a process-level `abort()` (V8 can only interrupt a
 * thread at a JS boundary; an interrupt delivered inside a native frame surfaces as a C++
 * exception with nowhere to go). tree-sitter's own deadline is the only bound that can actually
 * stop the work: it is checked inside the parse loop, and on expiry `parse()` simply returns no
 * tree. Nothing is killed, and the parser stays reusable for the next file.
 *
 * ## Honesty
 *
 * A budgeted result is a LOWER BOUND and reads as one. An abandoned file is never silently
 * dropped: {@link ParseBudgetExceededError} carries the elapsed time, the caller records the
 * file with reason `budget-exceeded`, and conclusions built over it disclose the boundary. The
 * bound is disabled by setting `OPENLORE_PARSE_BUDGET_MS=0`, which reproduces the previous
 * behavior exactly — the escape hatch for anyone who would rather wait than be told.
 *
 * A binding whose `setTimeoutMicros` is unavailable or unusable (older native builds, and the
 * web-tree-sitter WASM lane) simply parses unbounded, as it did before — {@link parseBudgetSupported}
 * reports which. That is a real limit of the bound, not a covered case: those languages keep the
 * pre-change behaviour, including the unbounded cost. It is called out in the change's spec rather
 * than papered over here.

 * the import demands a BigInt. Left to propagate, arming the deadline made every file in the

 * exists-but-throws deadline and silently empty extraction.
 *
 * Keyed on the parser's PROTOTYPE, not the instance. Keying the instance looked right and was
 * useless on the one lane it was written for: the WASM grammar handle constructs a fresh parser
 * for every file (its heap must not be shared), so the instance recorded on file N was never
 * consulted on file N+1 and the throw was re-paid every time. All instances from one binding share
 * a prototype, so this records the binding's capability, which is what is actually being learned.
