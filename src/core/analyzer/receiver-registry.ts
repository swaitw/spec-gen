/**
 * Per-file receiver type registries (change: shrink-receiver-resolution-boundary).
 *
 * The call graph resolves `this.m()` / `self.m()` by walking the enclosing class chain. The one
 * intra-object shape it cannot see at all is the CHAINED receiver — `this.<field>.<method>()` /
 * `self.<field>.<method>()`. The call query only ever captured an `(identifier)`, `(this)` or
 * `(super)` receiver, so a chained receiver matched no alternative: it produced no raw edge, no
 * resolved edge, and no `external::` leaf. It was the last call shape that was *silently* absent
 * rather than disclosed — `exception-flow.ts` classified it `other` and promised it resolved "to an
 * internal edge or an `external::obj.x` edge", which was not true for this shape.
 *
 * This module records the deterministic facts needed to type such a receiver: a class field's
 * declared type, and — where a field is initialized from a call to a locally-declared function —
 * that function's declared return type. Local *variable* types are already covered by
 * `type-inference-engine.ts`; this is the field/return dimension it never had.
 *
 * Four rules are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Declared types only, never inferred shapes.** A field types the receiver when the source
 *     SAYS its type (an annotation, a `new T()`, a call to a local function with a declared return
 *     type). Nothing is guessed from naming, usage, or assignment flow.
 *  2. **Conflict refuses.** One `Class.field` carrying two different types anywhere in the file is
 *     dropped outright — the receiver stays a disclosed boundary rather than binding to whichever
 *     declaration parsed first.
 *  3. **No second parse.** Facts are collected from the tree Pass 1 already owns, through the same
 *     query runner `collectClassRelationshipFacts` uses, and are plain data so they survive the
 *     extraction-worker structured clone and the Pass-1 fact cache JSON.
 *  4. **Fail-soft.** A grammar without the queried node types yields nothing (the runner already
 *     swallows query errors), which is the same deterministic answer on every lane.

 *    nested inside another `def` rebinds it; one function hop (the method itself) is expected,
 *    a second is a rebinding.
 *  - **An unnameable owner.** A class EXPRESSION with no name (`return class { … }`) owns the
