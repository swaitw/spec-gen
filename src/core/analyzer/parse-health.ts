/**
 * Parse-health disclosure (change: add-parse-health-boundary-disclosure).
 *
 * The language-support registry can't over-claim a *language* — but it says nothing about failed
 * extraction *inside* a supported language. A file the pinned grammar rejects, a tree tree-sitter
 * recovered with a large `ERROR` region, or a source that decoded lossily today yields a silently
 * smaller graph indistinguishable from "there is genuinely nothing there." This module records
 * per-file parse health so downstream conclusions can disclose *unknown* instead of implying
 * *absent* — the exact failure mode the `NoFalseCompleteness` requirement exists to prevent.
 *
 * Two honesty rules, mirroring the style-fingerprint and IaC extractors:
 *   1. Clean files pay zero: `tallyParseHealth` returns `undefined` unless the parsed tree actually
 *      carries an error, so a healthy repo produces no records and no boundary is ever emitted.
 *   2. The signal is a LOWER BOUND: an ERROR region can swallow well-formed neighbors, so a
 *      disclosed count is "at least this degraded," never "exactly this and no more."
 *
 * Tallied in the SAME per-file AST walk that extracts nodes/edges (no second parse), exactly like
 * the style fingerprint. Deterministic: integer tallies over a deterministic walk, sorted keys, no
 * clock — byte-identical across re-analyses of a fixed repository state.
