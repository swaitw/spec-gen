/**
 * Dynamic-boundary sites (change: disclose-dynamic-boundary-regions).
 *
 * The call graph already recovers *some* dynamic dispatch — event/route/callback synthesis, CHA
 * virtual dispatch. What it cannot follow at all is reflection (`getattr`, `send`, `Method.invoke`),
 * computed member dispatch (`obj[name]()`), `eval`/`new Function`, non-literal dynamic imports,
 * metaprogrammed definitions (`define_method`, `Proxy`), and DI-container resolution. Today those
 * constructs are *swallowed*: `getattr` sits in the Python ignore table, `reflect` resolves to a
 * bare `external::` edge, Ruby `send` has no handling at all. A file that dispatches only through
 * them produces a graph indistinguishable from a file with no calls — a confident-looking silence.
 *
 * This module records each such construct as a **dynamic-boundary site** so a conclusion can
 * disclose *unknown* instead of implying *absent*. It is the same move `parse-health.ts` makes for
 * failed parses and the epistemic lease makes for staleness, applied to the last large undisclosed
 * unknown in the graph.
 *
 * Four rules are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Records, never resolves.** A site NEVER produces a node or an edge. The matcher only records
 *     candidates; the one structurally provable family — a stable literal dispatch table — is bound
 *     after Pass 7 by `literal-reflection.ts` (change: resolve-literal-reflective-dispatch), which
 *     discharges exactly the candidates it binds.
 *  2. **The partition is by resolution OUTCOME, not argument form.** Every recognized construct is
 *     a *candidate*; {@link finalizeDynamicBoundarySites} retracts only those the resolver actually
 *     bound to an internal symbol. A static literal that resolves to nothing, or ambiguously, still
 *     yields a site — with its refusal reason. A syntactic partition would leave those in a silent
 *     hole, which is the exact failure this module exists to remove.
 *  3. **Grounded in syntax or a declared framework binding, never a bare callee name.** A method
 *     merely *named* `get`/`resolve`/`make` is not a container resolution: the file must also import
 *     a declared DI package. `.get(` alone matches hundreds of innocent call sites in any repo.
 *  4. **False-negative biased and fail-soft.** An unrecognized construct is simply not recorded,
 *     exactly as today. A language with no declared spec contributes nothing and is reported as
 *     *unsupported* by the capability registry — never as "contains no dynamic dispatch".
 *
 * Cost: no second parse — the walk runs over the tree the extractor already parsed, gated by a
 * substring pre-scan of the source. The gate is real but not free, and the honest figures are:
 * roughly 30% of this repository's TypeScript files trip it (the tokens `eval`, `require(`,
 * `import(` and `](` occur inside ordinary identifiers and CommonJS), and a triggered file costs
 * about 30% more extraction time than an untriggered one. An untriggered file pays only the
 * `indexOf` scans. Retained candidates are capped per file, so a generated dispatch table cannot
 * grow the payload that crosses the worker and fact-cache boundaries.
 *
 * Deterministic: integer positions over a deterministic walk, sorted output, no clock — so two
 * analyses of unchanged sources produce byte-identical artifacts.
