/**
 * Query-time overlay of the files the index is behind on
 * (change: overlay-dirty-files-at-query-time).
 *
 * OpenLore already knows, per query, exactly which files the index has not caught up
 * with — it computes the stale set and discloses it — and then answers from the stale
 * index anyway. The disclosure is honest and inert: the symbols most likely to matter
 * are the ones the caller just edited.
 *
 * Re-extracting those files is bounded, cacheable work rather than a re-analysis: Pass-1
 * extraction is a pure function of `(language, content)`, which is what makes the fact
 * cache sound and this overlay affordable.
 *
 * SCOPE, and the limit that comes with it: the overlay is SYMBOL-level. Re-reading a
 * file gives its own symbols, signatures and spans soundly. It does NOT re-resolve call
 * edges INTO those symbols from files outside the stale set — that is a whole-graph
 * operation and belongs to the watcher's incremental update. Callers of an overlaid
 * symbol therefore remain as the index recorded them, and every consumer discloses that
 * rather than implying otherwise.
