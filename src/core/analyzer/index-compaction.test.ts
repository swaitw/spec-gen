/**
 * Periodic compaction of the LanceDB search indexes (change: bulletproof-background-index).
 *
 * The watcher updates an index with `delete` + `add`, and LanceDB is append-only and versioned, so
 * every save leaves the previous version on disk. Nothing reclaimed them, and a machine that just
 * leaves the watcher running never hits the full `analyze` that happens to clean up — measured at
 * 401 MB of index holding 36 MB of live rows on a repository whose source is ~9 MB.
 *
 * The property that matters is BOTH halves: space is actually reclaimed, and not one row is lost
 * doing it. A compaction that quietly dropped rows would turn a disk-space chore into missing
 * search results, which is far worse than the bloat.
