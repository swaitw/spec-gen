/**
 * Content-hash-keyed memoization of Pass-1 extraction facts (change: optimize-hash-keyed-analyze).
 *
 * Pass 1 — per-file tree-sitter parsing and fact extraction — is a PURE function of
 * `(language, content)`. Nothing it produces depends on another file, on the clock, or on
 * anything outside the file's own bytes. That purity is what makes memoizing it sound: if the
 * bytes and the extracting code are both unchanged, re-parsing can only reproduce the answer
 * already on disk.
 *
 * So each file's Pass-1 output is stored keyed by
 *
 *     (file path, sha256(language + content), extractor stamp)
 *
 * and a later `analyze` reuses every row whose key still matches, re-extracting only the diff.
 * Global (cross-file) passes are untouched — they still run over the whole merged fact set.
 *
 * ## The stamp is the soundness boundary
 *
 * A memo is only as safe as its invalidation rule. The content hash covers the INPUT; the
 * stamp covers the FUNCTION — every input to extraction that is not the file's own bytes:
 *
 *  1. **OpenLore's own extraction code.** A digest over the source that implements Pass 1
 *     (see {@link STAMP_ROOTS}), so editing an extractor invalidates the cache with no
 *     version bump to remember. Deliberately over-broad: a root covers whole directories, so
 *     an unrelated edit inside one costs a re-extract. That error direction is free; the
 *     other one silently corrupts the graph. `pass1-fact-cache.test.ts` walks the real static
 *     import closure of the extraction entry point and fails if any module it reaches is
 *     outside these roots, so the coverage cannot rot as the analyzer grows.
 *  2. **The installed grammar versions.** The grammars are OPTIONAL dependencies loaded at
 *     runtime, so the same OpenLore build extracts differently depending on which are present
 *     and at what version — including the "grammar absent → this language yields nothing"
 *     case, which a cache must never freeze in.
 *
 * Anything the stamp cannot see is a stale-fact bug, which is why the stamp is computed from
 * evidence on disk rather than from a hand-maintained constant.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * No cross-machine cache sharing and no dependency graph of derived queries: facts are
 * memoized at exactly one boundary — per-file extraction — because that is where the cost is
 * and where the purity is already proven. `--force` (or `OPENLORE_NO_FACT_CACHE=1`) bypasses
 * the cache entirely and then repopulates it: the always-available escape, and the reference
 * output the reused lane is verified against.
