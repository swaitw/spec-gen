/**
 * Bounded repository-wide file scanning (change: fix-unbounded-file-scan-oom).
 *
 * Shared primitive for analyzer and indexing paths that fan reads across repository files.
 *
 * Every such scan used to be written `await Promise.all(files.map(async f => { const src =
 * await readFile(f, 'utf-8'); ... }))`. That issues one read per file *simultaneously*, so at
 * the peak the entire repository is resident in the heap — and `analyze` ran five of those
 * scans concurrently. Past a few hundred megabytes of source it is a fatal OOM, not a
 * slowdown: V8 aborts inside the read-completion path with no partial result, no artifact, and
 * no indication of which phase died (issue #302).
 *
 * Two bounds, because they fail independently and either alone still admits the crash:
 *
 *  - {@link mapFilesBounded} caps how many files are in flight, so peak residency is a function
 *    of the cap rather than of the repository's file count. This is the bound that fixes a
 *    repository of many ordinary files.
 *  - {@link readSourceCapped} caps how large a single file may be, so one generated or minified
 *    blob cannot exhaust the heap however low the concurrency is.
 *
 * `mapFilesBounded` resolves results in INPUT order, exactly like `Promise.all`. That is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic: several callers document that they depend on input
 * ordering so the artifacts they build are byte-identical across runs of a fixed repository
 * state (change: fix-artifact-output-determinism). Ordering by completion instead would make
 * the serialized graph a function of I/O timing.

 *
 * The size is measured BEFORE the read, which is the whole point: reading first and measuring
 * after would already have materialized the buffer and the string that the cap exists to prevent.
 *
 * Two things are required to make that actually true, and it is worth being precise about which
 * does what, because getting one of them is easy to mistake for getting both:
 *
 *  - The measurement and the read go through ONE open file handle, never a `stat(path)` followed
 *    by a `readFile(path)`. Those are two independent resolutions of the same NAME, so a path
 *    that was replaced or re-symlinked in between would be read at a size belonging to a
 *    different file.
 *  - The read is bounded to the size that was checked. This is the part a single handle does NOT
 *    give you: `handle.readFile()` reads to CURRENT end-of-file, so a file appended to after the
 *    `stat` is read in full — measured, a 1 KB file that grew to 20 MB during the await window
 *    came back as 20 MB through a 4 MB cap. Reading exactly `size` bytes into a buffer allocated
 *    at `size` bounds the allocation by construction, whatever the file does afterwards.
 *
 * For a tool that analyzes untrusted repositories — and that re-analyzes while a watcher is
 * rewriting files — this is a real boundary, not a theoretical one.
 *
 * A file that GREW is therefore truncated to the prefix that was measured. That costs nothing in
 * practice: for a file nobody is writing (every real scan) `size` IS the whole file, so the read
 * is exact and no character can be split.
 *
 * `null` deliberately does not distinguish "too large" from "unreadable" — a scan callback can
 * do nothing different about either. Callers that render user-facing disclosure pass
 * `onOversized`; it fires from the exact open-handle stat that enforced the cap, so the warning
 * does not depend on the repository walker's earlier size snapshot.
