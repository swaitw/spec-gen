/**
 * Bounded repository-wide file scanning (change: fix-unbounded-file-scan-oom).
 *
 * These cover the two properties the fix for issue #302 rests on:
 *  - a scan's peak residency is a function of its CONCURRENCY BOUND, not of the file count, and
 *  - a scan's peak residency is a function of its PER-FILE SIZE CAP, not of any one file's size.
 *
 * Plus the property the rest of the codebase silently depends on: results come back in INPUT
 * order, so artifacts built from a scan stay byte-identical across runs (and across changes to
 * the concurrency bound).
