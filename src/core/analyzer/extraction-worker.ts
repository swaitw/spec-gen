/**
 * Pass-1 extraction worker entry (change: optimize-parallel-extraction-pool).
 *
 * One instance of this module runs per pool worker. It holds this thread's own
 * tree-sitter parser and grammar singletons (the module-level caches in
 * `call-graph.ts` are per-module-registry, so a worker thread gets its own set for
 * free) and answers one request at a time:
 *
 *   parent → { type: 'extract', id, file }   worker → { type: 'result', id, value }
 *                                                   | { type: 'failed', id, message }
 *
 * It contains NO extraction logic of its own — it calls the same
 * `dispatchFileExtract` the serial lane calls, which is what makes the two lanes
 * provably identical rather than merely similar.
 *
 * Two honesty rules are implemented here:
 *
 *  - **Startup probe.** The extractors return an empty result (they do not throw) when a
 *    grammar cannot be loaded, so a worker whose bindings failed would silently contribute
 *    nothing to the graph. Before accepting work this thread parses a known-good snippet in
 *    the language the parent named and requires the expected node and edge; a worker that
 *    cannot do that reports itself `unhealthy` and is dropped. This is a FAST-FAIL, not the
 *    guarantee: it covers one language, and the pool's per-language unproven-silence guard
 *    is what actually makes an empty result trustworthy.
 *  - **Log relay.** Worker diagnostics must not interleave with the parent's spinner or
 *    write to stdout while it is carrying JSON-RPC. The logger is therefore redirected
 *    to the parent, which dedupes repeated messages across the pool.

/**
 * Probe sources, per language: one function containing one call — the minimum that proves a
 * real parse produced both a node and an edge.
 *
 * The parent picks which language to probe from the build's OWN files, because every
 * grammar is an optional dependency: probing TypeScript in a Python repo could disable the
 * pool over a grammar that repo never needed. A language absent from this table simply
 * skips the probe — the per-language unproven-silence guard in the pool still covers it,
 * so the probe is a fast-fail optimization, never the sole line of defense.

 * The `catch` in the request handler covers a throw the extractor *returns through*. It does not
 * cover a throw raised from a callback the native binding invoked, a rejection that escaped an
 * un-awaited promise, or an error raised between turns — those reach the thread's top level, and
 * a worker with no `uncaughtException` listener dies there. The parent notices (it listens for
 * `error` and `exit`) but only as "the worker holding file N vanished", which costs the pool a
 * worker and re-runs the file on the main thread — where, if the fault is deterministic, the same
 * thing happens with no thread boundary left to absorb it.
 *
 * So the fault is answered for the file it happened on, with the marker that makes the parent
 * record `worker-fault` rather than blaming the source. Then the thread retires: an
 * `uncaughtException` means unknown state, and a worker that keeps serving from unknown state
 * could return facts that are wrong rather than absent — which is the worse failure by this
 * codebase's rules. Retiring is cheap; the parent already handles a worker leaving mid-run.
