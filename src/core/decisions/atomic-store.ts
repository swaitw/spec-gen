/**
 * Durable, concurrency-safe persistence primitives for the JSON stores.
 * (change: harden-memory-integrity-invariant)
 *
 * OpenLore's promise — *never serve an unverified or stale fact as
 * authoritative* — is only as strong as the durability of the files behind it.
 * Both stores (`.openlore/memory/notes.json`, `.openlore/decisions/pending.json`)
 * are single JSON files rewritten in full. Without these primitives:
 *
 *   - a crash mid-write leaves a torn file that loads as a silent empty store
 *     (memory vanishes, nothing says so), and
 *   - two concurrent writers race: last-writer-wins silently drops the other.
 *
 * This module supplies three stdlib-only primitives (no new dependency, no LLM):
 *
 *   1. {@link atomicWriteFile} — write to a temp file, fsync, then POSIX-rename
 *      into place. A crash before the rename leaves the prior store intact.
 *   2. {@link casUpdate} — optimistic compare-and-swap on a monotonic `sequence`:
 *      load → mutate → commit only if the on-disk sequence is unchanged; on a
 *      conflict, re-read and re-apply the (append/supersede) merge rather than
 *      clobber. No concurrent write is lost.
 *   3. {@link quarantineCorrupt} — move a store that fails validation aside to
 *      `*.corrupt-<n>` and signal it, instead of silently substituting empty.

/**
 * Backoff for a rename that lost a race with another handle on the destination.
 *
 * POSIX `rename(2)` replaces the destination unconditionally. Windows does not:
 * `MoveFileExW(REPLACE_EXISTING)` returns `EPERM`/`EACCES`/`EBUSY` while ANY other
 * handle is open on the target. The window is milliseconds wide and the operation is
 * idempotent (the temp file is still there, fully fsync'd), so the correct response
 * is to wait and try again.
 *
 * WHO holds it is usually US, not an antivirus — measured on Windows 11 / Node 26
 * while investigating issue #457, after an earlier version of this note guessed at a
 * scanner and sent the investigation the wrong way:
 *
 *   - every open shape blocks it, `O_RDONLY` included (so `readFileConfined`'s
 *     `O_NOFOLLOW` is not special), and
 *   - `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` does NOT rescue it. A reader that explicitly grants
 *     share-delete still blocks the replace, so there is no share mode a reader can
 *     adopt to make this go away.
 *
 * The second point is the load-bearing one, so here is how to re-measure it rather than
 * take it on trust. Hold the destination open with `CreateFileW` called DIRECTLY — the
 * share flags then are exactly what Win32 receives — while `node` performs the rename, so
 * the call under test is the real libuv `MoveFileExW(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)`:
 *
 * ```
 * share READ|WRITE (no delete)  -> node rename FAILED EPERM
 * share READ|WRITE|DELETE       -> node rename FAILED EPERM
 * share DELETE only             -> node rename FAILED EPERM
 * no handle at all              -> node rename SUCCEEDED
 * ```
 *
 * Both halves of that harness matter. A first attempt used .NET's `File.Move(overwrite)`
 * to do the replacing and reported `ACCESS_DENIED` for every arm including the control —
 * it is not the same call, and it would have "confirmed" the conclusion for the wrong
 * reason.
 *
 * That second point is why this ladder is the ARCHITECTURE and not a workaround: with
 * nothing to fix on the read side, waiting for our own reader to close its descriptor
 * is the only way through. Any concurrent read of the artifact — a tool call serving
 * `llm-context.json` while the watcher publishes it — can cost a publish this way.
 *
 * Observed, not theorised: a Windows CI runner produced
 * `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename '….llm-context.json.tmp-…' -> '…llm-context.json'`
 * on the watcher's artifact write, which left the artifact at its previous
 * content — one of the two mechanisms behind issue #451.
 *
 * These codes essentially never occur for a same-directory rename on POSIX, so
 * this changes nothing there. The retries are bounded and the ORIGINAL error is
 * rethrown when they run out: a genuine permission problem still fails, loudly
 * and with its real message.
 *
 * The ~3.2s ceiling is dimensioned against the tail, not the median: a Defender
 * hold on a small just-written file is usually 10-100ms, but a first-touch scan
 * or a cloud-lookup can run far longer, and the machine that reported #451 was a
 * loaded one. It is deliberately far below the commit lock's own limits — 10s
 * before a lock is even a stale candidate, 30s before a waiter gives up — so a
 * writer that spends its whole budget still cannot cause a lock timeout or a
 * steal. (`graceful-fs` retries this same Windows class for 60s; that is sized
 * for arbitrary third-party writes, not for a section under our own lock.)

/**
 * Windows keeps retrying past the shared ladder; every other platform stops at it.
 *
 * The reason is the one measured above: on Windows ANY open descriptor on the destination
 * blocks the replace, share-delete included, and the descriptor is usually our own reader.
 * There is nothing to fix on the read side, so the only way through is to outwait the
 * reader — which makes the LENGTH of this ladder the whole mitigation, and worth more here
 * than on a platform where the failure cannot occur at all.
 *
 * A CORRECTION, recorded because the wrong version of it was committed here first: an
 * earlier note claimed this same extension was warranted because a clean `windows-latest`
 * runner never hit the contention in 10 runs while a real machine failed ~1 in 5, and
 * concluded from that clean negative that the holder had to be external. That inference
 * does not hold. The contention is timing-sensitive, so an idle runner simply never lands
 * in the window; not reproducing says nothing about WHO holds the handle. The direct
 * measurement — the holding pid read straight off the temp file name — says it is us.
 *
 * Extended to ~6.4s rather than `graceful-fs`'s 60s: the ceiling that matters is the commit
 * lock's. 10s is when a lock becomes a stale candidate and 30s is when a waiter gives up,
 * so a writer that spends its whole budget must still finish well inside both. This doubles
 * the tolerated hold while keeping that property.
 *
 * POSIX is unchanged: a rename there replaces the destination whatever has it open, so an
 * `EPERM` is a genuine permission error and retrying it for seconds only delays a real
 * failure.
