/**
 * Issue #451 — the atomic write must survive a Windows rename that lost a race.
 *
 * POSIX `rename(2)` replaces the destination unconditionally. Windows does not:
 * `MoveFileExW(REPLACE_EXISTING)` needs DELETE access to the target, so it fails
 * with `EPERM`/`EACCES`/`EBUSY` while any other handle is open on it without
 * `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` — an antivirus or Search Indexer scanning the file it just
 * saw written, or a reader that opened it a millisecond earlier.
 *
 * This is not a hypothesis. A Windows CI runner produced exactly this while
 * running the watcher's durability suite:
 *
 *   [mcp-watcher] error: EPERM: operation not permitted, rename
 *     '…\.llm-context.json.tmp-5316-5' -> '…\llm-context.json'
 *
 * The artifact was left at its previous content with no other trace — one of the
 * two mechanisms behind #451.
 *
 * `rename` is retried rather than worked around: the temp file is still there and
 * fully fsync'd, so each attempt is the same single atomic replace and atomicity
 * is untouched. The retries are bounded, and a genuine permission problem still
 * fails with its own message rather than being swallowed or masked.
 *
 * `node:fs/promises` is mocked here so the race is deterministic on every
 * platform; it cannot be provoked on POSIX, and provoking it on Windows would
 * mean racing a scanner.
