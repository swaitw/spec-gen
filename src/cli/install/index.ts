Examples:
  $ openlore install                 Detect agents, wire them up, build the index
  $ openlore install --agent claude-code
  $ openlore install --agent pi       Install the Pi extension (.pi/extensions/openlore.js)

  $ openlore install --dry-run       Preview changes without writing

  $ openlore install --uninstall     Remove OpenLore-managed entries (both scopes)

Bare \`openlore install\` wires your USER scope as well as this repository: every
git repository you open afterwards reaches the OpenLore MCP server and builds its
index in the background on first touch. That background build never leaves a git
work tree, discloses itself once per repository, and is disabled per repository
with \`"autoInit": false\` in .openlore/config.json (or OPENLORE_NO_AUTO_ANALYZE=1).

Pi (pi.dev) loads a JS extension rather than MCP: the \`pi\` surface writes
\`.pi/extensions/openlore.js\`, which starts \`openlore serve\` on demand and injects
context itself. \`pi install npm:openlore\` and \`openlore setup --tools pi --global\`
(all projects, ~/.pi) are the equivalent host-side and global routes.

After install, orient() is available immediately — the configured MCP server
(\`openlore mcp\`) starts automatically when your agent launches, and the index
stays fresh as you edit (disable the file watcher with \`openlore mcp --no-watch-auto\`).
