/**
 * Job-grouped `openlore --help` (change: refine-happy-path-and-defaults /
 * CommandSurfaceGroupedByJob).
 *
 * OpenLore has ~49 top-level commands. Commander's default help lists them in one
 * flat block, so `install` and `orient` sit beside the experimental `panic-*`
 * suite and `gryph-watch` with no altitude marker — a new user can't tell the
 * front door from the basement. This module groups the Commands section of the
 * top-level help by JOB (set up · navigate · govern a change · inspect · multi-repo
 * · advanced/experimental), mirroring the capability families.
 *
 * It only changes PRESENTATION. Every command stays invocable, and any command not
 * yet categorized falls through to an "Other" group, so a newly-added command is
 * never hidden — it just shows ungrouped until it is placed.
 *
 * Grouping is delegated to Commander's own `.helpGroup()` support (added in
 * Commander 14): each subcommand is tagged with its job heading and Commander renders
 * the groups. We previously hand-reproduced Commander 12's `formatHelp` to do this,
 * which broke on upgrade when `Help.wrap()` was removed. Tagging instead of
 * reproducing means every other part of help rendering — wrapping, padding, styling,
 * usage, options — stays Commander's, so it cannot drift again.
 *
 * The one thing Commander does not decide for us is group ORDER: it emits groups in
 * the order subcommands were registered. `orderCommandGroups` reorders them into the
 * job order declared below.
