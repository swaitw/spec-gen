/**
 * Build the middleware that gates EVERY route of a browser-facing surface, and

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The viewer used to embed its token in the HTML it served and gate
 * only `/api`, which meant `/` was unauthenticated: any other process on the machine
 * could `curl http://127.0.0.1:PORT/`, read the token out of the page, and then drive
 * the token-gated, LLM-backed chat route. The token was the mitigation against exactly
 * that attacker, and the page handed it out.
 *
 * The exchange (the model Jupyter uses): the CLI opens the browser at `/?token=<t>`;
 * the first request presenting a valid token gets an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie
 * and a redirect that strips the token from the URL (so it does not linger in history
 * or leak via Referer). Every later request — the page, its assets, its `/api` calls —
 * authenticates with the cookie the browser now holds. A process that curls `/` with no
 * credential gets a 401 instead of the key.
 *
 * HttpOnly keeps the cookie out of `document.cookie`, so injected page script cannot
 * read it back out; SameSite=Strict means it is never attached to a cross-site request,
 * which (with the Origin/Host checks above) is what keeps a cookie-authenticated
 * surface from being CSRF-able.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, stated plainly: the token appears once in the URL, so it is briefly visible
 * in the argv of the browser-open process (world-readable on Linux) and in the browser's
 * own history. That is a much narrower window than a page that serves the token to
 * anyone who asks, but it is not zero — the same trade Jupyter makes.
