/**
 * A schema bump must not strand the user (change: shrink-receiver-resolution-boundary).
 *
 * When `SCHEMA_VERSION` moves, every graph tool refuses with "run `openlore analyze` to rebuild
 * it". Analyze's skip, however, was gated on SOURCE freshness alone — so on an unchanged tree it
 * answered "up to date — source unchanged" and did nothing, leaving the user in a loop: told to
 * run a command that declines to act, with no working call graph until they guessed at `--force`.
 *
 * The skip is now additionally gated on the published store being readable by THIS build. These
 * tests pin the probe that decides it, in both directions — a future schema bump must not be able
 * to reintroduce the stranding.
