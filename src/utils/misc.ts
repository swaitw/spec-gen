 *     DOT. Escaping quotes alone does not prevent that, which is why this is done
 *     here rather than left to the caller.

 * Newline/CR/tab become their DOT escape sequences (the backslash is emitted after
 * step 1, so it stays a real escape). Any other control character has no DOT
 * representation and is dropped; two names differing only by such a character would
 * collide, which is accepted as strictly better than emitting a corrupt graph.

/**
 * Neutralize terminal control sequences in a value that came from an analyzed
 * repository, before it is printed.
 *
 * OpenLore's job is to read repositories it does not trust and report on them, and
 * SECURITY.md scopes exactly that. A file name may legally contain ESC on Linux and
 * macOS, so a hostile repository can smuggle cursor-movement, screen-clear or OSC
 * sequences through any path/symbol OpenLore echoes back. Printed raw, those let the
 * repository being analyzed overwrite OpenLore's own output — for a tool whose value
 * is a trustworthy verdict, a forged "[ok] all checks passed" line is the attack,
 * not a cosmetic glitch.
 *
 * Everything in C0, DEL and C1 is removed, which includes ESC and therefore every
 * sequence introduced by it (CSI, OSC, DCS) without needing to parse them. Newline
 * and tab go too: these are single-line display values (a path, a symbol name), so a
 * newline in one is itself a way to forge an extra output line.
 *
 * Three classes of NON-C0 Unicode formatting characters go with them, because C0 alone
 * is not the whole attack surface:
 *   - bidi overrides and isolates (U+202A-U+202E, U+2066-U+2069) and the marks
 *     U+061C / U+200E / U+200F reverse rendered text, so a decision title or symbol
 *     name can display as the opposite of the bytes OpenLore actually verified;
 *   - the line/paragraph separators U+2028 / U+2029 start a new line in many
 *     terminals and editors — the same forged-extra-line attack as `\n`.
 * These also matter on the MCP/JSON path, which C0 stripping does not need to cover:
 * `JSON.stringify` escapes control characters to `\uXXXX` but passes every one of
 * these through verbatim. This is the same class `sanitizeReviewValue` neutralizes
 * before repository text reaches a PR comment; keep the two in step.
 *
 * This is for UNTRUSTED values only. OpenLore's own color codes are applied by the
 * shared color layer AFTER this runs, so they are unaffected.
