/**
 * Path confinement for values that came from an analyzed repository.

 * OpenLore reads repositories it does not trust (SECURITY.md scopes exactly that),

 * committed `.openlore/config.json`, and the layout of `openspec/` itself — a repo
 * can commit a SYMLINK there, and git will check it out. Neither may be allowed to
 * redirect a read or a write outside the project root.
 *
 * These primitives live in a leaf module (no OpenLore imports) because the sites
 * that need them span the MCP handlers, the CLI, the decision syncer and the
 * analyzer; a shared guard that only one face can import is how the drift that
 * motivated this file happened in the first place.
