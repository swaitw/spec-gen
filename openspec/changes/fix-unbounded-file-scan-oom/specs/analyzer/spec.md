## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: RepositoryWideScansAreBoundedInConcurrencyAndFileSize

An enrichment scan that reads source files across a repository SHALL bound both the number of
files it holds in memory at once and the size of any single file it will read. Neither bound alone
is sufficient: a repository of many ordinary files exhausts the heap through fan-out, and a
repository containing one generated blob exhausts it through a single read.

The per-file size SHALL be measured BEFORE the file is read. Reading first and measuring after has
already allocated exactly what the cap exists to prevent.

Transient source-read residency during enrichment SHALL be a function of the bounds, not of the
repository's file count or total bytes.

#### Scenario: A large repository is scanned under a small heap

- **GIVEN** a repository of several hundred megabytes of source across hundreds of files
- **WHEN** the enrichment extractors scan it under a heap far smaller than the repository
- **THEN** every extractor completes, and peak memory tracks the concurrency bound rather than the
  repository size

#### Scenario: One oversized file cannot exhaust the heap

- **GIVEN** a repository containing a single generated file far larger than the per-file cap
- **WHEN** a repository-wide scan runs
- **THEN** that file is skipped without being read into memory, and the other files are scanned
  normally

### Requirement: BoundedScansPreserveInputOrder

A bounded repository-wide scan SHALL return its results in INPUT order, identically to an unbounded
`Promise.all`, and independently of its concurrency width.

This is a correctness property, not a convenience. Artifacts built from these scans must be
byte-identical across runs of a fixed repository state; under a concurrency bound, completion order
depends on which worker frees a slot first, so input-order aggregation is the only thing keeping
those bytes stable.

#### Scenario: Adversarial completion order does not reorder output

- **GIVEN** a file list longer than the concurrency bound, whose reads complete in reverse order
- **WHEN** the route and env-var inventories are built from it
- **THEN** both are ordered by the file list, and repeated runs produce identical bytes

### Requirement: FilesTooLargeToScanAreDisclosed

A file excluded from an enrichment scan because it exceeds the per-file size cap SHALL be disclosed
to the operator with its path and size, and the affected inventories SHALL be described as a LOWER
BOUND.

A silently dropped file makes a component, route, or environment variable that genuinely exists
read as genuinely absent — the failure mode the analyzer's disclosure discipline exists to prevent.
The disclosure SHALL be emitted from the same scan-time size observation that applies the
threshold, so an earlier repository-walk snapshot cannot make the two surfaces disagree.

#### Scenario: An oversized file is reported rather than dropped

- **GIVEN** a repository containing a file above the scan's per-file cap
- **WHEN** `openlore analyze` runs
- **THEN** the run completes and reports the excluded file, its size, and that the enrichment
  inventories are a lower bound

### Requirement: EnrichmentExtractorsDoNotMultiplyTheScanBound

The enrichment extractors SHALL NOT run as one concurrent batch. Each is internally bounded;
running them together multiplies that bound by the number of extractors, which is what exhausted
the heap. Running them in sequence costs no additional I/O, since they read the same file set.

#### Scenario: Adding an extractor does not raise peak memory

- **GIVEN** the enrichment phase of `openlore analyze`
- **WHEN** the extractors run
- **THEN** peak residency is that of a single bounded scan, regardless of how many extractors the
  phase contains
