# Tasks — optimize-parallel-extraction-pool

> Status: BUILT + adversarially reviewed. Measured on this repo (macOS, 10 cores, pool size 8):
> call-graph build **18.9s → 7.2s** (2.6×); full `openlore analyze --no-embed` **24.7s → 12.6s**
> (2.0×). Pass 1 was 14.3s of the 20.2s serial build (71%) before the change.

## Implementation
- [x] Worker entry module (`src/core/analyzer/extraction-worker.ts`): receives the build's file
      record and runs the SAME `dispatchFileExtract` the serial lane runs (per-worker parser
      singletons come free from the per-thread module registry; the Lua/Dart WASM grammars keep
      their isolated-module discipline per worker), then posts plain fact objects (nodes, raw
      edges, CFG, style, parse-health)
- [x] Deviation from the proposal, deliberate: workers receive the file's CONTENT, not just its
      path. `build`'s input content is authoritative and is not always what is on disk — HTML
      pages arrive inline-script-blanked, the incremental path passes in-memory content, and test
      builds pass synthetic files — so a worker-side re-read would change facts, not just I/O
- [x] Startup parse probe in the worker: the extractors return EMPTY (they do not throw) when a
      grammar is unavailable, so a worker proves it can parse one known snippet before it accepts
      work; an unhealthy worker is dropped rather than silently contributing nothing
- [x] Worker→parent log relay: grammar-unavailable warnings are posted to the parent and deduped
      there, so an unavailable language is disclosed once per run, not once per worker
- [x] Pool lane in `CallGraphBuilder.build`: Pass 1 split into an EXTRACT step (pooled or serial)
      and a MERGE step that walks `files` by index — completion order can never reach the graph
- [x] Pool sizing constants in `src/constants.ts` (`EXTRACTION_POOL_MAX`,
      `EXTRACTION_POOL_MIN_FILES`, `EXTRACTION_POOL_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS`); size =
      `min(availableParallelism() - 1, EXTRACTION_POOL_MAX, fileCount)`; pool created once per
      build, terminated after Pass 1
- [x] Fail-soft ladder: per-file worker death → serial re-extract of that file on the main thread;
      an extractor that THROWS inside a worker is recorded as that file's parse failure (identical
      to the serial lane, no retry); no healthy worker / unresolvable worker entry /
      `OPENLORE_NO_WORKERS=1` → wholesale serial; a worker that never reports ready is dropped on
      a startup timeout instead of hanging analyze. Every degraded outcome is disclosed on the
      build result (`CallGraphResult.extractionLane`) and warned in the analyze output
- [x] Serial path kept as the reference implementation — it is also the fallback executor, and the
      pool module contains no extraction logic at all

## Hardening from adversarial review (three review passes)
- [x] **Never trust an unproven silence.** The startup probe covers ONE grammar; the other ~20 load
      lazily and independently per thread, and an unavailable grammar returns EMPTY rather than
      throwing. So a worker's empty result is re-checked on the main thread until that worker has
      demonstrably extracted that language, and a disagreement is disclosed as a lane defect.
      Measured cost on this repo: **0 re-checks** on a healthy run (a real parse of a
      function-less file still yields style counters, so ordinary empty files are never mistaken
      for silence)
- [x] **Probe a language the build actually contains.** Every grammar is an optional dependency, so
      probing TypeScript in a Python repo could disable the pool over a grammar that repo never
      needed. The parent names the build's dominant language; a language with no probe snippet
      skips the probe and relies on the per-language guard
- [x] **No hang paths.** A reply whose id does not match the outstanding request retires the worker
      (previously it was ignored, leaving the request armed forever); every per-file request has a
      deadline; startup has one too, lowered to 10s since a healthy worker reports in well under a
      second; a process that has proven workers cannot start remembers it instead of paying that
      stall on every later build
- [x] **Nothing writes to stdout.** `openlore mcp` speaks JSON-RPC over stdout and runs builds
      in-process; a worker inherits no console patching. Workers now keep their stdout off the
      parent's (drained, stderr still inherited), and the lane note is returned on the build result
      for the CLI to render instead of being logged from the builder
- [x] **Worker count is bounded per PROCESS, not per build.** The daemon runs builds concurrently
      (a background self-heal rebuild alongside a tool-call build); each would otherwise plan a full
      pool and double the resident isolate count. A build that finds the budget spent runs serial
- [x] Worker handle registration moved inside the try that terminates it; `poolSize` documented as
      "workers that came up", not "workers still alive"; a note at the merge catch that only
      `error.message` survives the worker boundary

### Round 3 (re-review of the hardened code)
- [x] **The guard covered only half the hazard.** A per-language grammar load that fails inside a
      worker does NOT return empty — `getPyParser` and friends do not wrap their `import`, so it
      THROWS. That error was trusted unconditionally, which would have written `parseFailed` and
      dropped every symbol for files the serial lane extracts fully — a graph that depends on which
      lane ran, and on scheduling. An error from an unproven worker is now re-checked exactly like
      an empty result; an error from a PROVEN worker is still a real per-file parse failure
- [x] **`terminate()` was an unbounded await on all three release paths.** V8 can only interrupt a
      thread at a JS boundary, so a thread wedged in a synchronous native call may never exit —
      re-creating the hang the deadlines exist to prevent and stranding its process-budget slot
      forever. The wait is now bounded and the slot is returned regardless
- [x] **The lane disclosure was dead plumbing** — computed, carried on `AnalysisArtifacts`, and read
      by nobody, so `laneDefectFiles` never reached a human. `openlore analyze` now renders it
- [x] Sticky "workers do not work here" is set only for a DETERMINISTIC failure (every worker
      refused to spawn or reported unhealthy), not for a startup timeout — a load spike must not
      drop a long-lived daemon to the serial lane for good
- [x] Two comments claimed a watcher opt-out that does not exist. Corrected to state what is true:
      the watcher DOES use the pool (measured 516ms → 292ms on a 33-file subset rebuild), and what
      bounds the daemon is the per-process worker cap, not the file-count floor
- [x] `proven` now requires a defined, non-empty result, so `undefined` (a language with no
      extractor) no longer marks a language proven

### Round 4 (convergence review — test honesty)
- [x] The shipped-entry guard resolved a sibling `.js` tsc never emits, so it skipped silently in
      a fully built checkout. Repointed at repo-root `dist/`, wired into the CI Build job, and
      verified to fail on a corrupted compiled entry
- [x] Deleted a test that asserted nothing about its own name: it injected a throwing extractor as
      `serialExtract`, which a healthy stub worker never calls, so it would have passed with the
      worker error path deleted outright. The behavior is covered by the proven-worker error test
- [x] Probe-table guard: every snippet in `PROBES` is checked against the real extractor for a node
      AND an edge. A snippet that quietly stops yielding both would disable the pool process-wide
      with no failing test
- [x] Deleted the write-only `worker` payload on the unfilled-slot record (and the generic it
      forced); the disclosure now reports lane defects AND worker fallbacks when both occurred,
      and says "reported no symbols" since the defect covers a throw as well as a silence
- [x] Qualified the "byte-identical" comments: a worker thread's larger default stack means a
      pathological deep-recursion parse can fail on one lane and not the other — a different FILE
      failing to parse, disclosed through parse health either way, not a different reading of a
      file that parsed
- [ ] KNOWN LIMIT (not fixed here): the lane note is rendered by `openlore analyze` only, so a
      lane defect during the daemon's cold-start or self-heal rebuild is not surfaced to a human.
      Matches the spec as written; a counter on `parse-health.json` or `openlore status` would
      close it

## Verification
- [x] Byte-equality oracle: `openlore analyze` on a clean checkout of this repo, pooled and with
      `OPENLORE_NO_WORKERS=1` — every content artifact byte-identical (llm-context, repo-structure,
      dependency-graph, style-fingerprint, parse-health, all inventories, CODEBASE/ARCHITECTURE).
      The four artifacts that do differ (SUMMARY.md, fingerprint.json, refactor-priorities.json,
      vector-index-meta.json) differ ONLY in a wall-clock timestamp, and differ identically
      between two SAME-lane runs — pre-existing, not lane-dependent
- [x] Order-independence test: a stub pool that answers later files FIRST (asserting the
      completion order really was inverted) still yields a byte-identical serialized graph,
      including the colliding-symbol case where merge order decides which node survives
- [x] Worker-crash test: one worker dies mid-file, and separately all workers die — every file is
      accounted for, facts identical to serial, fallback disclosed
- [x] WASM-in-worker test: Lua and Dart fixtures interleaved with TypeScript extract identically
      on real threads and on the main thread (asserted non-empty, so the comparison cannot pass by
      both lanes finding nothing)
- [x] Real-thread test: `worker_threads` workers spawn, probe, extract, and match serial byte for
      byte (`extraction-pool-threads.test.ts`)
- [x] Wall-clock measured and reported above; no unmeasured speedup claims anywhere in docs
- [x] Unproven-silence tests: a blind worker's graph is byte-identical to serial and its defect is
      disclosed; an ordinary function-less file costs zero re-checks; a language with no style
      counters is re-checked only until the worker proves it; a language with no extractor is a
      deterministic answer, not a silence
- [x] Protocol/budget tests: an off-protocol worker is retired instead of hanging the pass; the
      worker budget is shared across concurrent builds and returned when they finish
- [x] Worker-error tests: a worker that THROWS for an unproven language has every file re-checked
      and the defect disclosed; a worker that fails everything still yields a graph byte-identical
      to serial with no invented `parseFailed` records; an error from a PROVEN worker is still
      recorded as that file's parse failure
- [x] Scheduling-independence test: across 12 runs at pool sizes 1-4 with randomized interleavings
      over a mixed-language corpus, the re-check set genuinely VARIES (asserted) and the serialized
      graph never does — the exact question the unproven-silence guard raises
- [x] Shipped-entry test: `dist/core/analyzer/extraction-worker.js` — the file the npm package
      ships, which no other test loads because vitest always resolves the `.ts` entry — starts and
      reports ready. CI runs it in the Build job, the only job where `dist/` exists. Verified it
      FAILS on a deliberately corrupted compiled entry (the first version of this guard looked for
      a sibling `.js` that tsc never emits, so it silently skipped in a built checkout — caught by
      review, not by the suite)
- [x] MCP stdio purity: drove `openlore mcp` over stdio through a cold-start pooled build plus
      an `orient` call — every stdout line a valid JSON-RPC frame, build noise on stderr
- [x] Full suite green (321 files / 6150 tests), lint + typecheck clean

## Spec
- [x] `analyzer` delta: ADD ExtractionPoolPreservesDeterministicOutput
