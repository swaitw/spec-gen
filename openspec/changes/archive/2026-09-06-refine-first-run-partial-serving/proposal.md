# The first index is all-or-nothing: minutes of "no index found" before the first answer

> Status: PROPOSED (2026-07-23, competitive substrate sweep). On a repo of real size, the first
> `analyze` takes minutes — and until it finishes, every tool answers "no index found." Yet the
> pipeline already processes files in significance order (hubs and entry points first), so
> thirty seconds in, the most valuable fraction of the graph exists in memory and is worth
> serving. The field's convergent answer is serve-partial-while-indexing: answer from what
> exists, disclose completeness, finish in the background. OpenLore already has exactly this
> contract for STALE indexes (serve stale + "refresh started" disclosure); this change extends
> it to the ABSENT case — the first-run experience, which is also the onboarding experience.
> Composes with `optimize-incremental-and-coldstart-scale` (which moves the first build off the
> server's event loop; this change makes its output usable before completion).

## The gap

- **Absent ≠ stale in today's serving contract.** `cold-start-bootstrap.ts` serves reads from
  the STALE index with a disclosure while a rebuild runs (`:16-27`, `:154-165`), but when no
  index exists (`hasAnalysis`, `:79-81`) tools fall back to "run analyze" guidance
  (`index-absent`, `:50`) for the entire build.
- **The value ordering already exists and is wasted.** `RepositoryMapper` sorts all files by
  significance score descending (`repository-mapper.ts:780`, `:828`;
  `significance-scorer.ts:462`), so Pass 1 (`call-graph.ts:3979`) processes hubs and entry
  points first — and then nothing is visible until the final artifact write.
- **No mid-build flush exists.** Artifacts are written once at the end
  (`artifact-generator.ts`); there is no partial artifact, no completeness figure, no way for
  the epistemic lease to say "index 34% complete."
- The cost lands exactly at first contact: zero-interaction onboarding (PR #216) auto-starts
  the build, and the new user's first minutes with the product are its emptiest.

## What changes

1. **A partial flush during an index-absent build.** The pipeline flushes a partial index once
   the repository structure and dependency graph exist — before the call-graph pass, which is
   most of the wall clock — with an atomic write, its own content-digest commit, and a receipt
   stamped `{filesExtracted, filesTotal, phase, partial: true}`.

   *(As built: one flush at the extractors boundary, not a per-file cadence. A per-file flush
   would have to re-run merge and resolution over a prefix — see "What this does NOT do".)*
2. **The absent case adopts the stale case's serving contract.** Reads during an index-absent
   build serve from the partial index with a disclosed boundary naming what it holds, what it
   does not yet hold, and that unreached facts are invisible to the answer rather than absent
   from the repo.

   *(As built: no completeness percentage. The honest denominator would be the call-graph pass,
   which has not started, so any percentage in that position reads as "how much of the index
   exists". The receipt names the build stage instead. The significance-ordering clause is gone
   too: the flush contains every mapped file, so it was ordering nothing.)* Negative conclusions that
   partiality can invert — dead-code candidates, coverage gaps, "no callers" — are withheld or
   explicitly downgraded while `partial: true`; navigation and positive lookups serve normally.
3. **Completion erases partiality.** The final write is byte-identical to today's
   single-write output (the determinism oracle applies), clears the `partial` stamp, and the
   lease returns to its ordinary lifecycle. A partial artifact is never importable, exportable,
   attestable, or bundleable — it exists only for local serving during the build.
4. **CI stays single-shot.** The flush lane activates only for the interactive/daemon
   first-run path; `--embedded`/CI builds keep today's one-write behavior.

**Deliberately NOT borrowed** from the serve-while-indexing field: no query-time on-demand
parsing (answers come only from flushed facts — the deterministic artifact stays the single
source of truth), and no background prioritization scheduler beyond the significance order
that already exists.

## What this does NOT do (settled during implementation)

The partial index carries repository structure and the dependency graph, and those are SERVED:
`get_architecture_overview`, `get_file_dependencies` and orient's architecture-rule scan read
them through a fallback that fires only after the published read returns null, so a repository
with an index pays nothing. It does **not** carry a partial call graph. Pass 1 extracts every file before the merge and resolution passes run, so
flushing a servable graph mid-pass would mean re-running merge and resolution over a prefix:
extra work on every build, and a second path through exactly the machinery the determinism
oracle exists to protect. The receipt therefore NAMES the call graph and the search index as not
yet built rather than implying the index has them, and `orient` — which gates on the search index
— keeps returning not-ready, now with the build's progress instead of "run openlore analyze".

The measured shape of the build is what makes this worth doing anyway: on this repository the
mapping, dependency-graph and extractor phases finish in 2.2s of a 15.4s build, so the partial
index exists for ~85% of the wall clock. On a repository of real size that is minutes during
which the answer changes from a dead end to a disclosed partial one.

## Why this is in scope

First impressions are the product's conversion funnel, and "structural answers within seconds
of install, honestly labeled" is the strongest first impression a substrate can make. The
change is a composition of shipped disciplines — significance ordering, atomic writes, the
stale-serving disclosure contract, the determinism oracle — extended to one uncovered state.

## Impact

- Files: `src/core/runtime/partial-index.ts` (new — the whole partial-index lifecycle),
  `src/core/analyzer/analysis-core.ts` (flush cadence + clear on publish),
  `src/core/analyzer/artifact-generator.ts` (the `partial` stamp on `LLMContext`, a
  structure-only accessor), `src/cli/commands/analyze.ts` and
  `src/core/services/cold-start-bootstrap.ts` (lane gating),
  `src/core/services/mcp-handlers/utils.ts` (absent-case serving + the response receipt),
  `confidence-boundary.ts` (the `partial` marker and the withhold guard),
  `reachability.ts` / `coverage-gaps.ts` (negative-conclusion guards),
  `src/cli/commands/mcp.ts` (one disclosure point for every tool),
  `src/core/analyzer/index-bundle.ts` (export/import refusals).

  The partial index is written OUTSIDE the analysis directory rather than into it. That was
  the load-bearing decision: `hasAnalysis`, the fingerprint, the published generation, the
  attestation and every exporter read the analysis directory, so keeping the partial index out
  of it makes "a partial index is never an artifact" structural instead of a rule five call
  sites have to remember.
- Specs: `architecture` — 1 ADDED requirement (FirstRunServesPartialWithACompletenessReceipt).
- No new tool. Risk: medium — the hazard is a partial answer read as complete; mitigated by the
  `partial` stamp riding the lease into every response, the negative-conclusion withhold rule,
  and the never-export rule. Coordinate with `optimize-incremental-and-coldstart-scale`
  (child-process build emits the flushes; the server only reads).
