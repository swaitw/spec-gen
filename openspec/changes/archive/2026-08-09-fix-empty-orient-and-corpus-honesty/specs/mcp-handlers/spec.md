## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: EmptyOrientationsExplainThemselves

An `orient` result with no relevant functions SHALL carry a deterministic empty-result
disclosure: the identifier-shaped query tokens that matched nothing in the corpus, and, for each,
any indexed identifier token that shares a prefix or substring relation with the missed token
(either token may contain the other), as a "near token" receipt. The lookup SHALL be bounded over
the existing corpus vocabulary and use no model or new index. The disclosure SHALL state facts
about the miss, never guess an answer.

#### Scenario: A morphological miss names its near token

- **GIVEN** a keyword-mode index whose only matching identifier is `greet`
- **WHEN** `orient` runs for the task "change the greeting"
- **THEN** the empty payload discloses that `greeting` matched nothing and that `greet` is an
  indexed near token

#### Scenario: A genuinely foreign query discloses the miss without a near token

- **GIVEN** the same index
- **WHEN** `orient` runs for "kubernetes ingress rules"
- **THEN** the payload discloses the missed tokens and contains no fabricated near token

### Requirement: NextStepsAreConditionedOnResultShape

The `nextSteps` (and equivalent guidance fields) of an orientation SHALL be conditioned on the
result's shape. An empty briefing SHALL suggest actions appropriate to a miss — an identifier-
style `search_code`, `get_map`, and the near-token receipt when present — and SHALL NOT carry
implement-then-verify workflow steps that presuppose results. A populated briefing keeps the
existing guidance.

#### Scenario: An empty briefing does not advise recording decisions

- **GIVEN** an orient call that matches nothing
- **WHEN** the payload is served
- **THEN** `nextSteps` contains miss-appropriate suggestions and does not contain the
  record_decision / check_spec_drift boilerplate

### Requirement: UserFacingFunctionCountsAgree

Every user-facing count of indexed functions (the analyze/install epilogue's "Function index
built (N functions)") SHALL agree with the call-graph function count for the same analysis, or
SHALL state exactly what else it includes. Two counts of the same population in one output SHALL
NOT silently differ.

#### Scenario: The epilogue counts match

- **GIVEN** a repository whose call graph contains 5 functions
- **WHEN** install's index build completes
- **THEN** the function-index message reports 5, or explicitly names the additional entries it
  counted
