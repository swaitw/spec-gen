## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: EditVerdictIsDerivedAtPatchTime

When the watcher patches the graph for an edited file, it SHALL derive a per-edit verdict from
the pre/post facts already in hand: removed-or-renamed symbols with surviving resolved call
sites (`edit-broken-reference`, each caller named `file:line`), provably incompatible call
sites against changed signatures (`edit-arity-mismatch`), imports of names the file no longer
exports (`edit-import-breakage`), and the reaching tests for the edited symbols. The verdict
SHALL be derived after the entire coalesced edit batch has been patched. Reaching tests SHALL
be selected by exact node identity from the retained full-analysis graph, SHALL disclose that
basis, and SHALL become stale when a source or test basis hash changes. Production graph APIs
SHALL NOT be widened with test nodes solely for this feature. The verdict SHALL persist beside
the artifacts keyed to its analysis generation, edit content hash, and fact-basis hashes, and `openlore check-edit`
SHALL serve it as a read — no analysis in the read path. In hook mode, infrastructure failure or
an absent daemon SHALL never block (advisory default; blocking only via `enforcement.policy` on
the registered codes), and with no daemon the command MAY compute a one-file scoped diff
directly, disclosing the slower path.

#### Scenario: A deleted export with live callers becomes a finding within one debounce

- **GIVEN** a daemon-watched repo where an edit deletes an exported function that two other
  files call
- **WHEN** the watcher's patch for that save completes
- **THEN** the persisted verdict contains `edit-broken-reference` naming both call sites
  `file:line`, and `check-edit` returns it without re-parsing anything

#### Scenario: The hook never blocks on infrastructure

- **GIVEN** hook mode with no daemon running and a store that fails to open
- **WHEN** `check-edit --hook` runs
- **THEN** it exits non-blocking with the failure disclosed on stderr — a broken substrate
  never vetoes an edit

### Requirement: EditVerdictNeverGuessesIncompatibility

An `edit-arity-mismatch` finding SHALL be emitted only when incompatibility is provable from
stored facts: argument count below the required (non-defaulted) parameter count, or above the
total parameter count with no variadic/spread/lower-bound marker involved. Default parameters,
variadics, spread arguments, overloads, and out-of-scope languages SHALL produce no finding.
Language scope SHALL be disclosed in the verdict; silence outside the provable set is the
contract — the verdict is a sound lower bound on breakage, never an over-approximation.

#### Scenario: A provable mismatch fires

- **GIVEN** a Python function changed from `def f(a, b)` to `def f(a, b, c)` (no defaults) and
  a stored call site with exact `argCount: 2`
- **WHEN** the verdict derives
- **THEN** `edit-arity-mismatch` names that call site

#### Scenario: A default parameter silences the check

- **GIVEN** the same change but `def f(a, b, c=1)`
- **WHEN** the verdict derives
- **THEN** no arity finding is emitted — compatibility is possible, so the verdict says nothing
