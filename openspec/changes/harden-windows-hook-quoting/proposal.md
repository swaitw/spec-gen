## Why

`openlore install` wrote a Windows hook command whose entry path was not quoted, so every
`SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` fired `Cannot find module` (#483, fixed by #484 from
@L4XB). The rule quoted a part only when it held a space or a cmd.exe metacharacter:

```ts
.map((part) => /[\s&|<>^%!()]/.test(part) ? `"${part}"` : part)
```

`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` was quoted because it has a space. An nvm-windows entry
path has none, so it went through bare — and Claude Code runs a hook through **Git Bash**,
where a bare `\` is an escape that is dropped. The reporter's path arrived as
`C:UsersmeAppDataRoamingnvm...index.js`.

The defect was not the regex. It was that the Windows branch was written for cmd.exe and
never asked the shell that actually runs the string, and every unit test agreed with the code
because both encoded the same assumption. Only a real shell could have caught it.

Asking one (`bash`, the shell Git Bash ships) shows the fix is right for ordinary paths and
that **double quotes do not make a POSIX shell literal**. Inside them a backslash still
escapes `$`, a backtick, `"` and another backslash, and `$`/backtick still expand. Four
shapes therefore remain wrong, two of them worse than the bug #484 fixes:

| Part | Emitted `"…"` becomes | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `C:\a"\x.js` | quote closes early | **the rest of the line runs as code** |
| `C:\Users\me\` | trailing `\` escapes our own `"` | **swallows every later argument** |
| `C:\Users\a$b\x.js` | `$b` substituted | wrong path, silently |
| `\\srv\share\…`, `C:\$Recycle.Bin\…` | `\\` / `\$` lose a backslash | #483's own error, one turn at a time |

## What Changes

**#484's outcome is kept, and its mechanism is inverted.** Quoting the entry path is right
for cmd.exe, Git Bash and PowerShell, and it is what users need today. But #484 gets there by
adding `\` to a DENYLIST, and a denylist is only ever as complete as the next character
someone thinks of: over 900 random parts, 84 that the denylist emitted BARE came back mangled
or dangerous, because an unquoted word exposes a different set of metacharacters — `;`, `'`,
`~`, `*`, `?`, `#`, brace expansion, the empty string. `a;id` alone runs `id`.

The POSIX branch never had this problem: `quotePosix` is an ALLOWLIST and single-quotes
everything else, sound by construction. The Windows branch now matches it — quote unless the
part is only characters no shell treats specially. Same result for every real path (all
contain `\`, `:` or a space), same readable bare `orient --json`, and the bare branch stops
being a second, unmodelled quoting rule.

**The four unrepresentable shapes are REFUSED, not emitted.** No single string means the same
thing to cmd.exe and to a POSIX shell for them, so `formatPlatformCommand` throws instead of
writing a line that silently fails or executes code — the protection `quotePosix` already
gives the POSIX branch, which the Windows branch was missing for the same input.

**A refusal costs the hooks, and nothing else.** `runInstall` rethrows a project-scope adapter
error, so the writers check first (`windowsCommandHazard`) instead of letting the throw escape.
What they then do matters as much: an unquotable path is a property of the HOST, not a clash
with the user's file, so it is not reported as a conflict. The MCP entry (an argv), the
instruction block (prose) and the tool permission (a literal) are all still correct and are
still written; only the hooks are left out. Treating it as a conflict returned exit 1, which
also skipped the index build — one unwritable field cost the entire install.

A hook OpenLore wired earlier is REMOVED on such a host, not left in place. It names a command
this host mangles, so keeping it is #483's `Cannot find module` once per turn, forever, with
nothing saying why; a user-authored entry in the same group survives untouched.

`openlore update` only ever PRINTS a command — it spawns its own argv without a shell — so on
Windows it prints the plain package-manager command for the detected method instead of the
resolved form. That is not merely a fallback: a statement whose first token is a quoted path
parses in PowerShell as a string EXPRESSION, so the resolved line is a syntax error there
rather than an invocation. Printing the command the user actually meant is correct for cmd.exe,
PowerShell and bash alike, and it keeps every `$`-shaped path out of a shell whose expansion
rules differ from the POSIX ones the refusal models.

**Uninstall is decoupled from formatting.** `managedHooks` was called on the removal path for
its keys alone, so an unformattable path would have thrown there too — stranding the hooks
uninstall exists to remove. The keys are now a constant.

**A real Windows host checks the real hook.** The Windows smoke job already asserted the wired
MCP launcher executes, but never ran the hook STRING through a shell — which is exactly how
#483 shipped green. It now writes the hook command to a script, runs it under the runner's own
Git Bash, and requires a version back, so the reporter's failure cannot return unnoticed.

**A real shell is the oracle.** `platform-command.posix-oracle.test.ts` emits the command the
installer would write, hands it to `bash`, and asserts the argv that comes back is the argv we
meant. It pins #483 itself (the old predicate, and the reporter's exact mangled path), proves
the injection case executes when unguarded, and drives the EMITTER over a hostile corpus so
guard and shell cannot drift. The corpus goes through `formatPlatformCommand`, not a
hand-written `"…"`: comparing against the quoted form only is what hid the bare branch, and
the same corpus reports 84 failures against the denylist emitter and none against the
allowlist. Its probes run in a throwaway directory, because a part that escapes its quoting
redirects — which first surfaced as stray files in this repo's own working tree.

## Deliberately NOT done

- **The hook string is not switched to POSIX single quotes**, which would carry all four
  shapes perfectly. Evidence says Git Bash runs our hooks, but a single-quoted line is
  meaningless to cmd.exe, so being wrong about that would break every working Windows install
  to fix a shape almost nobody has. The double-quote form stays; the unrepresentable rest is
  refused.
- **No forward-slash normalization.** It rescues UNC and a trailing separator, but not `$`
  (`"C:/$Recycle.Bin/x"` still expands), so it would trade one silent mangling for another
  while changing the emitted path for every Windows user.
- **cmd.exe's `%VAR%` expansion is not defended.** No string form suppresses it, and a literal
  `%` path round-trips under the Git Bash that actually runs our hooks — refusing it would
  break a working install to appease a shell we do not target. Disclosed at the code. `!VAR!`
  under delayed expansion is the same shape and equally undefendable.
- **A UNC install is now an unsupported host, explicitly.** `"\\\\srv\\share\\…"` is fine for
  cmd.exe but collapses to one backslash in bash, and neither forward slashes nor single quotes
  fix it for both. Such a host gets everything except the hooks, with the reason named, rather
  than a hook that cannot run.
- **A bare `cmd /c` is not a supported carrier.** Its two-quotes-only rule strips the first and
  last quote of a line like ours. Nothing OpenLore writes is run that way — Node's `shell:true`
  wraps with `/d /s /c` — and no string form would survive it.
- **No new spec domain.** One `cli` requirement, mirroring `SubprocessesNeverSurfaceAConsoleWindow`.
- **Two adjacent crashes are left alone**, deliberately, because they are pre-existing and have
  a different cause — cannot LOCATE a command, rather than cannot QUOTE one. Both are filed:
  `resolveOpenloreCommand` still throws out of a project-scope adapter when `npx-cli.js` cannot
  be found or the Node path is not absolute (`mcpEntry` runs before any check), and
  `doctor --fix` discards `runInstall`'s exit code and reports a rewire as corrected either
  way. Fixing them here would widen the claim this change is making.
