# Tasks — shrink-receiver-resolution-boundary

> Scoped after measurement on this repository's own graph. The direct `this.m()` / `self.m()`
> shape already resolves (521 `self_cls` edges). The shape that resolved to NOTHING — no edge, no
> `external::` leaf, and therefore nothing any conclusion could disclose — is the CHAINED receiver
> `this.<field>.m()` / `self.<field>.m()`: 261 sites in this repository alone, because the call
> queries only ever captured an `(identifier)`, `(this)` or `(super)` receiver. That is the
> boundary this change shrinks and then discloses.

## Implementation
- [x] Per-file receiver registry built during the Pass-1 walk (`receiver-registry.ts`): class field
      types from annotations, `new T()` initializers, constructor parameter properties, Python
      `__init__` annotations forwarded to a field, plus locally-declared function return types for
      a field initialized from a factory. Local variable types stay with the existing
      `type-inference-engine.ts`. No second parse — the same fail-soft query runner
      `collectClassRelationshipFacts` uses
- [x] Capture the chained receiver in the TS/JS and Python call queries, carried as
      `RawEdge.receiverField` (NOT a dotted `calleeObject`, which the import strategy would bind
      to a same-named import)
- [x] Bottom-up receiver resolution as its own strategy: type the field walking the class chain,
      then resolve the method within that one type via the existing affinity ladder; emit a
      `receiver_inferred` edge only on a unique candidate
- [x] Only emit on an unambiguous type. A field observed with two types is refused; an ambiguous
      candidate set is recorded as an ambiguous call site; a typed receiver with no such member
      emits nothing
- [x] Emit NO `external::` leaf for the residue — that would assert the callee leaves the project
- [x] Exclude chained raw edges from the CHA feed: their `calleeObject` is the bare `this`/`self`
      token, so CHA would name-bind `this.repo.save()` inside the caller's own hierarchy
- [x] `exception-flow.ts`: classify a self-rooted chained receiver as `self-field` (scoped to the
      registry languages), and disclose the unresolved residue in `analyze_error_propagation`
      under its own boundary — the callee's provenance is unknown, not merely unreached
- [x] Plumb the facts across the worker structured-clone and Pass-1 fact-cache boundaries, with a
      `FACT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump so a pre-change cached row cannot silently un-resolve a file
- [x] `language-support.ts`: `receiverResolution` capability sourced from the live
      `RECEIVER_REGISTRY_LANGUAGES`, plus `docs/language-support.md` and the standing-context table

## Verification
- [x] Resolution tests, one per declared-type source (annotation, `new T()`, parameter property,
      local factory return type, inherited field, Python `__init__`, Python in-place construction)
- [x] Boundary tests: untyped field, conflicting declarations, typed receiver without the member,
      receiver outside any class — each asserts ZERO edges, not merely no internal edge
- [x] No-false-edge test: a receiver whose name collides with an import is never bound to it
- [x] Ambiguity test: two same-named candidate types record an ambiguous site, not an edge
- [x] Capability test: every `RECEIVER_REGISTRY_LANGUAGES` member resolves a fixture; a non-member
      resolves none
- [x] Additivity: direct `self_cls` resolution unchanged; determinism across repeated builds
- [x] Full suite green

## Hardening (four adversarial review rounds)
- [x] Round 1 — soundness: an import binding for the type name is DECISIVE where present (a
      namesake elsewhere was binding); a write inside a `this`-rebinding construct, a field of an
      anonymous class expression, a `static` declaration, a plain constructor parameter, and a
      capitalized Python LOCAL FUNCTION no longer type a receiver
- [x] Round 1 — disclosure: `isSelfRootedMember` now peels `!`/parens and accepts index and call
      hops, so `this.dep!.m()`, `(this.dep).m()`, `this.map['k'].m()` and `self.get_dep().m()` are
      disclosed instead of silently absent; the boundary sentence names every refusal cause, not
      just an untypeable receiver; an ambiguous site is disclosed ONCE and renders `this.repo.save`
      rather than the non-existent `this.save`
- [x] Round 1 — scope: `#private` field receivers and Python class-body annotations now resolve;
      the capability description no longer claims other languages disclose this shape (Go records
      nothing for it — named as an open gap)
- [x] Round 1 — tests: every finding above pinned; the disclosure half (`self-field` classification
      and `untypedReceiverCalls`) pinned in `exception-flow.test.ts` and
      `error-propagation.test.ts`; `receiverFields` added to the fact-cache round-trip

- [x] Round 2 — integration: the same "renders a call site the source does not contain" defect in
      `blast_radius` / `analyze_impact` (`this.save` for `this.repo.save`), which reaches
      `structural_diff`, the chat tools and `openlore review`; `SCHEMA_VERSION` 11→12 so an OLDER
      OpenLore fails honestly instead of dropping the new rows and rejecting a valid `.olbundle` as
      tampered; stale capability lists in `docs/mcp-tools.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; the CLI view type
- [x] Round 2 — soundness: an import binding is now DECISIVE (a package-imported `Client` was
      binding to an in-project namesake); a STATIC-context write no longer types the instance
      field; `super.<field>` reads the PARENT's slot; the wrapper peel reaches `as` / `satisfies` /
      `<T>` / `await`
- [x] Round 2 — dogfood: 4 external repositories (poetry, nest, typeorm, mikro-orm), 1,508 new
      edges, **0 false positives** across a 55-edge hand audit, a whole-population automated check
      and a 126/126 same-name-class disambiguation check; **0 pre-existing edges removed or
      changed**; disclosure verified on real code
- [x] Round 3 — the round-2 fixes themselves: `private static` hid the `static` keyword behind the
      accessibility modifier (a false edge); the parent walk was breadth-first, contradicting
      Python's MRO (a wrong callee); the wrapper peel was INERT because each wrapper arrives inside
      parentheses, and `type_assertion` puts its type first; the external-import marker refused
      `src/`-layout Python packages and every TS path alias (recall regressions I introduced); an
      external marker shadowed a concrete binding for the same name
- [x] Round 3 — claims: re-measured every figure with the extractor itself. The chained-site count
      was wrong (261 → **327**, against 544 direct — 38%, which is what the "roughly a third" claim
      had right); `self_cls` 521 → 522. Corrected in the proposal, the tasks and the PR body
- [x] Round 3 — declared what was refused but undeclared: generic/union/namespace-qualified
      annotations, interface-typed fields, the per-file fact cap, cross-file inherited fields, and
      the external-import refusal itself; fixed the false Ruby claim in the capability text and
      completed the five-step "add a language" checklist (two of its steps fail SILENTLY if missed)

- [x] Round 5 — upgrade safety, found by dogfooding the real upgrade: after the schema bump every
      graph tool said "run `openlore analyze`" and `analyze` answered "up to date — source
      unchanged" and did nothing, stranding the user with no call graph. The skip is now gated on
      the published store being READABLE by this build, not only on source freshness — a gap that
      was general and would have bitten on any future bump
- [x] Round 5 — disclosure reach: the human `orient` and `orient --inject` (the SessionStart hook
      every Claude Code user runs) never printed `graphIndexNote`, so 100% of upgraders would see a
      briefing with no callers and no way to tell "nothing calls this" from "I could not look".
      Both surfaces now say it, and the injected line rides the mandatory-line path so a tight
      budget cannot drop the boundary while keeping the detail it qualifies
- [x] Round 5 — blast-radius guard: the chained alternative was added to the SHARED `TS_CALL_QUERY`,
      where a compile failure empties the entire TS/JS call graph (the Python side uses a separate
      soft query and risks only the alternative). Pinned by a per-grammar compile test
- [x] Round 5 — value audit: measured the ANSWERS, not the edge counts. `main` answered six
      "how does A reach B" questions on a stock NestJS app with `path: null` AND
      `confidenceBoundary.complete: true`; all six now resolve. 19 functions `main` called "no
      internal caller" demonstrably had one. Four of my own claims were measured wrong and corrected

## Spec
- [x] `analyzer` delta: ADD IntraObjectReceiverResolutionViaTypeRegistries,
      ResidualReceiverBoundaryStaysDisclosed, ChainedReceiverResidueIsScopedAndDeclared
