# Shrink the intra-object receiver boundary with deterministic per-file type registries

> Status: PROPOSED (2026-07-03, e2e audit pass 4) — **re-scoped 2026-09-06 after measuring this
> repository's own graph.** The original draft aimed at `this.helper()`, assuming it was the
> unresolved shape. It is not: direct intra-object calls already resolve through the class chain
> (522 `self_cls` edges here). The shape that resolves to *nothing* is the CHAINED receiver.

## The gap

`this.<field>.<method>()` / `self.<field>.<method>()` produces **no edge of any kind**. The call
queries only ever captured an `(identifier)`, `(this)` or `(super)` receiver, and a chained
receiver is a nested member expression, so it matched no alternative: no resolved edge, no
`external::` leaf, and — because `exception-flow.ts` classified it `other`, a kind documented as
"resolves to an internal edge or an `external::obj.x` edge" — nothing any conclusion could
disclose either. It is the last silently-absent shape rooted at `this`/`self` — a claim now bounded
by measurement rather than assertion: a class-name static-field receiver (`Holder.shared.work()`)
is still both unbound and undisclosed, identically before and after this change.

It is not rare. Counted with the extractor itself over this repository's `src/`: **327 chained
intra-object call sites against 544 direct ones — 38% of all intra-object calls**, concentrated
exactly where dependencies are held as fields (`this.store.…`, `this.logger.…`, `this.spinner.…`).
Every one of them silently NARROWED `analyze_error_propagation`'s escape set — an unreachable
callee contributes no exceptions, so a clean result was under-reporting rather than proof — and
left the field's type looking uncalled.

## What changes

1. **A per-file receiver registry, built during the Pass-1 walk.** `Class.field → Type` from
   DECLARED types only: a field's type annotation, a `new T()` initializer, a constructor parameter
   property, a Python `__init__` annotation forwarded to the field, and the declared return type of
   a function declared in the same file (for `this.repo = makeRepo()`). No second parse — the same
   fail-soft query runner the inheritance collector already uses. Local *variable* types stay where
   they are, in `type-inference-engine.ts`; this adds the field and return-type dimension it lacked.
2. **Bottom-up receiver resolution as its own strategy.** Type the field (walking the class chain,
   so an inherited field still types), then resolve the method **within that one type** through the
   existing affinity ladder. A unique candidate becomes a `receiver_inferred` edge — a distinct
   provenance tier, below a directly-resolved binding and above name-only. Today that tier's value
   is PROVENANCE LABELLING, not weighting: it costs the same as `type_inference` in `callDistance`
   and nothing branches on it. Keeping it distinct anyway is the point — a declared FIELD type is a
   different kind of inference from a local variable's, and collapsing the two is the silent
   flattening this substrate exists to refuse.
3. **The residue is disclosed, never papered over** — by `analyze_error_propagation`, which is the
   only surface that discloses it. `blast_radius`, `select_tests` and `find_dead_code` still see
   nothing at an untypeable chained site; they saw nothing before either, so this is not a
   regression, but the shape is now *partly* disclosed rather than fully. An untypeable field, a field observed with two
   conflicting types, an ambiguous candidate set, or a typed receiver with no such member emits
   **nothing** — not a guessed edge, and deliberately not an `external::` leaf, which would assert
   the callee leaves the project. `exception-flow.ts` gains a `self-field` receiver kind and
   `analyze_error_propagation` discloses those sites under their own boundary, distinct from the
   unresolved-intra-object one: here the callee's *provenance* is unknown, not merely unreached.

**Explicitly NOT built:** flow-sensitive or cross-file type inference; typing a field from its
usage; reassignment analysis; imported-factory return types (unreadable from this tree); deeper
chains (`this.a.b.m()`), computed receivers (`this.map['k'].m()`) and receivers obtained from a
call (`self.get_dep().m()`), all of which stay disclosed rather than bound; callees dropped by the
language's builtin-noise filter; and non-registry languages, which keep today's behaviour. Go is
named as an open gap: its call query captures no chained receiver at all, so it records nothing for
the shape — the capability matrix says so rather than implying every other language discloses it.

## Measured on real code

Four external repositories, `analyze --force` with both builds, full edge-row diff:

| repo | files | new `receiver_inferred` | pre-existing edges removed or changed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| python-poetry/poetry (Python) | 447 | 29 | 0 |
| nestjs/nest (TS) | 1,835 | 530 | 0 |
| nestjs/nest @`39fbddae` (re-measured) | 1,925 | 397 | 0 |
| typeorm/typeorm (TS) | 3,596 | 530 | 0 |
| mikro-orm/mikro-orm (TS) | ~3,900 | 419 | 0 |

The two `nest` rows are different clones, and the count moves with the tree; `poetry`'s 29
reproduced exactly across both runs, so the method is stable even though the figure is not.

**Zero false positives.** 55 edges hand-verified against source, plus 12 more on the re-measure; a whole-population automated
check over all 1,508 new edges; and for every edge whose callee class name is duplicated in the
repository, the binding was checked against the caller's own import — 126 of 126 correct in
`nest` alone. No new edge points at an external, synthetic or dangling node.

The disclosure side works on real code too: `insert::ClosureSubjectExecutor.ts` in typeorm reports
16 chained-receiver boundary sites where `main` reports none, including
`this.queryRunner.dataSource.driver.escape(...)` — a three-level chain the resolver deliberately
does not read, disclosed rather than guessed.

**A second-order effect worth naming:** in `mikro-orm`, one call site gained 6 imprecise
`cha-name-only` edges the branch did not create. `EntityLoader.findChildren`'s `children.find(…)`
is an `Array.prototype.find` that CHA fans out over every `find` in the repository; `main` drops
that fan-out whole because it exceeds `CHA_FANOUT_CAP`. Two of those candidates are now directly
resolved elsewhere and filtered out, pushing the site *under* the cap so the remainder are emitted.
The imprecision is pre-existing and honestly labelled `synthesized` — this change only alters which
sites the cap happens to hide. Left alone deliberately: suppressing it would mean re-tuning CHA's
cap semantics, which is a different change.

## Upgrade notes

Audited by running the real upgrade, not by reasoning about it. One true break was found and
fixed (analyze answering "up to date" on a store it could not read — see `tasks.md`). What remains
is disclosed rather than silent:

- **First analyze after upgrading is a cold build.** `FACT_FORMAT_VERSION` 6→7 invalidates the
  per-file extraction cache once: measured `re-extracted 4 file(s), reused 0 cached`. On a
  1,000-file repo that is roughly 19–30s instead of 11–14s, once.
- **Downgrading needs `openlore analyze --force`.** An older build reads a schema-12 store,
  discloses the mismatch correctly in `doctor` and `orient --json`, and falls back cleanly on
  bundle import — but its own `analyze` still answers "up to date" (it predates the fix above).
- **Two OpenLore builds sharing one repository will flap the store 11↔12.** Bounded and
  non-corrupting — no quarantine files, no data loss beyond the `receiver_inferred` edges the old
  build cannot represent, and the new build heals it — but the OLD side reports success with no
  signal that it downgraded the graph, and its watcher goes inert after spending its repair budget.
  Not fixable from this side; worth knowing before pinning two versions in one CI.
- **Two visible metric shifts, both improvements:** `report_coverage_gaps` moves (796 → 761 gaps
  on this repository) because fewer functions are falsely "unreached", and
  `analyze_error_propagation` gains a chained-receiver boundary. On a low-bind repository that
  boundary is mostly builtin-shaped receivers (`this.map.get`, `this.items.push`) — bounded to one
  summary line plus a 15-item sample, and confined to that one tool.

## Decisions to record

Two choices here set precedent beyond this change and should be captured as ADRs through
`openlore decisions --consolidate` when a provider key is available (the consolidation path
requires an LLM, so this change could not record them itself — they are written out here so the
reasoning is not lost):

1. **A new `EdgeConfidence` tier, `receiver_inferred`, at cost 2.** It sits with `type_inference`
   and `type_name`: a DECLARED field type is strong evidence, but still one inference removed from
   resolving the callee's own qualified name. Everything that enumerates confidences now derives
   the set from `CALL_DISTANCE_COSTS`, so adding a tier can no longer silently bypass a validator.
2. **An import binding is decisive, and a name from an unresolvable specifier is refused.** This
   contradicts the last rung of the pre-existing affinity ladder (bind a single repository-wide
   definition) wherever the source has said where the name comes from. It will govern future
   resolution strategies, and it is why `SCHEMA_VERSION` moved.

## Why this is in scope

Call-graph recall is the substrate every conclusion inherits, and this closes the `this`-rooted
family of shapes that were *silent* rather than disclosed. The technique is deterministic, local, and needs no
LSP or type checker — the same posture as the rest of the analyzer.

## Impact

- **Files:** `receiver-registry.ts` (new), the TS/JS and Python call queries and their extractors,
  the Pass-2 resolution ladder and the CHA feed (`call-graph.ts`), `RawEdge`/`EdgeConfidence`/
  `AmbiguousStrategy`/`EDGE_CONFIDENCE_VALUES` and the call-distance costs (`call-graph-types.ts`),
  the Pass-1 fact cache (`FACT_FORMAT_VERSION` 6→7, so a pre-change cached row cannot silently
  un-resolve a file), `import-resolver-bridge.ts` (the unresolvable-specifier marker),
  `exception-flow.ts`, `error-propagation.ts`, `language-support.ts`, and the three runtime
  validators whose hand-written confidence sets are now derived (`edge-store.ts`, `graph.ts`,
  `analysis.ts`), plus `edit-verdict.ts` (a comment), `cli/commands/error-propagation.ts` (a view
  type), `docs/language-support.md`, `docs/mcp-tools.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`SCHEMA_VERSION` 11 → 12 — a one-time rebuild for every existing database.** `edges.confidence`
  is unconstrained TEXT, so without the bump a NEWER database opened by an OLDER OpenLore would
  pass the version gate and then have every `receiver_inferred` row dropped by that build's own
  validator, and an `.olbundle` import would recompute its digest through that same dropping reader
  and reject a valid bundle as *tampered*. The bump turns both into the honest `schema-mismatch`
  rebuild path. This is the highest-impact consequence of the change and is recorded in an ADR.
- **Specs:** `analyzer` — 3 ADDED (IntraObjectReceiverResolutionViaTypeRegistries,
  ResidualReceiverBoundaryStaysDisclosed, ChainedReceiverResidueIsScopedAndDeclared).
- **Tool surface:** no tool added or removed. `analyze_error_propagation`'s RESPONSE shape gains
  `summary.untypedReceiverCalls` and an optional top-level `untypedReceiverCalls` block — additive,
  but consumers read that shape.
- **Risk:** a wrong receiver type produces a wrong edge. Mitigated by binding only DECLARED types,
  by treating an import binding for the type name as DECISIVE where one exists, by attributing a
  field only to the class that provably owns it (no `this`-rebinding construct, no unnameable class
  expression, no `static` slot, no plain constructor parameter, no capitalized local function), by
  refusing a field with conflicting declarations, by searching within one type rather than the
  global name space, by requiring a unique candidate, and by keeping the chained shape out of every
  strategy that keys off the bare receiver token — including CHA, which would otherwise name-bind
  `this.repo.save()` inside the caller's own hierarchy. The one inference that remains is binding a
  single repository-wide definition when no import binding exists — the same unique-name step the
  rest of the ladder already makes, and unavoidable because Python's absolute intra-project imports
  resolve to nothing.
