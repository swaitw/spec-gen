# Change status

Which proposals are built and which are not — decided by evidence, not by each proposal's own
status line. Two signals, both cheap to re-check:

- **built** — the change's name appears in a `change: <name>` marker in `src/`, and/or every
  requirement its delta adds is already in `openspec/specs/<domain>/spec.md` (verify against the
  code before trusting a marker-less "shipped" claim)
- **archivable** — `openspec archive <name>` completes

## State as of 2026-07-27 (spec-backlog repair pass)

The corpus is fully green: **all 15 main specs and all 94 open changes pass `openspec
validate`**, and the archive machinery works again. This pass:

- **Repaired the main specs** that had blocked archiving since the corpus first drifted:
  39 decision-synced requirements fixed across `cli` (22), `mcp-handlers` (15+Purpose),
  `config` (1), `overview` (1) — missing scenarios backfilled, 11 cross-domain stubs rewritten
  as normative deferrals with pointer scenarios, 3 double-"The system SHALL" glitches fixed,
  and the missing `## Purpose` added to `mcp-handlers`. The decision-sync template recurrence
  fix shipped and was archived as `2026-08-01-fix-decision-sync-template-validity`.
- **Archived 28 changes** (as `2026-07-27-*`): the 12 formerly "built, blocked on bookkeeping",
  all 10 formerly "claims built" (each verified against the code first — all 10 were real),
  `fix-analyze-native-abort-and-file-cost-budget` (PR #294), and the 3 `defer-*` scope-decision
  records (archived `--skip-specs` as resolved doc-only changes; their won't-do rationale
  remains readable in `archive/`).
- Two archives needed delta refreshes first: `make-index-self-healing` (its MODIFIED target
  `ReadyOrHonestFirstUse` was never in the corpus — converted to a self-contained ADD) and
  `unify-navigation-and-governance-substrate` (its MODIFIED block predated the ADR-0023
  substrate-default flip — refreshed to shipped reality). Two were archived `--skip-specs`
  because their requirements were already synced verbatim (`fix-pi-parity-drift`,
  `fix-redaction-module-gaps`).

## Complete — 150 in `archive/`

Everything in `openspec/changes/archive/` is shipped (or a settled won't-do), with its
requirements reflected in the main specs. `openspec list` shows only open work.

## In flight — 0

(`shrink-receiver-resolution-boundary` merged in #465 and awaits archiving.)

A change belongs here the moment its implementation starts; move it back out (archive it) the
moment its marker/spec evidence lands.

## To build — 96

The whole open set is unbuilt backlog. Newest additions: 7 proposals from the 2026-07-27
first-run e2e (`E2E-FIRSTRUN-2026-07-27.md`). Other thematic indexes:
`E2E-AUDIT-2026-07.md`, `KNOWN-LIMITATIONS-2026-07.md`,
`COMPETITIVE-SUBSTRATE-2026-07.md`.

Shipped since compile: `harden-walker-corpus-boundary` (2026-08-02, archived) — the walker
truncation receipt, includePatterns-override-directory-pruning, and nested-`.gitignore` semantics;
`harden-api-decision-and-generate-safety` (2026-08-08, archived) — decision-sync transition
enforcement, scoped TLS configuration, verification-evidence disclosure, and consolidation logs;
`fix-first-analysis-self-contamination` (2026-08-08, archived) — installer-owned artifacts no
longer skew domains, languages, or high-value files, and undomained source files are disclosed;
`fix-inject-relevance-gate-keyword-mode` (2026-08-08, archived) — exact identifier and scale-free
rank evidence make task-scoped injection reachable in the zero-config keyword mode;
`fix-empty-orient-and-corpus-honesty` (2026-08-09, archived) — empty orientations explain their
misses with bounded near-token receipts, and synthetic external nodes no longer enter the
searchable function corpus; `widen-import-resolution` (2026-08-09, archived) — Go, Java, Kotlin,
C#, and PHP now resolve statically unique package/import bindings at `import` confidence;
`add-secret-redaction-boundary` (2026-08-09, archived) — source-carrying tool results and both
sides of persisted LLM logs share deterministic, disclosed credential redaction;
`disclose-stale-serving-on-cold-reads` (2026-08-09, archived) — cold navigation reads disclose
changed cited files and active watcher/serve hosts schedule repository-scoped repair;
`align-first-run-ctas-with-repo-shape` (2026-08-09, archived) — install gates the prove CTA on
the built graph, sparse refusals carry receipts, fresh empty spec stores are informational, and
uninstall names retained data; `fix-mcp-argument-contract` (2026-08-15, archived) — omitted tool
directories resolve to the validated server launch root, explicit roots still win, and strict
advertised schemas reject unknown arguments before any watcher, rebuild, telemetry, or write;
`harden-llm-request-lifecycle` (2026-08-15, archived) — timeouts abort provider fetches and
streams, provider ceilings are constants-backed, correction requests retain their contract,
truncation is disclosed once, and fallback model ids are pricing-consistent;
`harden-review-render-and-action` (2026-08-15, archived) — PR-head text is inert in Markdown,
analysis freshness and failures are disclosed, and the bundled Action documents and enforces its
write-token trust boundary without suppressing configured policy gates;
`harden-llm-output-contract` (2026-08-16, archived) — malformed structured entries no longer
discard valid siblings, truncation and provider errors fail explicitly, and every LLM-derived
verification metric and mixed composite carries its evidence and model provenance;
`fix-commit-gate-delivery` (2026-08-16, archived) — every Git-hook installer targets Git's
effective hook path, manager-owned hooks fail honestly, doctor checks reachability, concurrent
edits are atomic, and machine JSON envelopes carry an explicit schema version.
`add-change-evidence-audit` (2026-08-16, archived) — `openlore change-status` now computes the
marker/spec-sync evidence pass with receipts, delegates typed non-interactive validation to the
OpenSpec CLI, and emits human, JSON, or pasteable table output without mutating lifecycle state.
`add-agent-loop-enforcement-hook` (2026-08-30, archived) — explicit blocking policy findings can
stop an agent turn with remediation-first feedback, while frozen findings and infrastructure
failures remain advisory; Claude Code wiring is opt-in and idempotent.

After this table was compiled, four research sweeps added 32 more proposals (all validate; not yet
folded into the table): 10 in `FIELD-RESEARCH-2026-07.md`, 10 in `ECOSYSTEM-RESEARCH-2026-07-27.md`,
5 in `SUBSTRATE-WHITESPACE-2026-07-27.md`, and 7 in `GOVERNANCE-SUBSTRATE-2026-07-31.md` — see those
indexes for the per-change one-liners.

The 2026-07-31 governance-substrate sweep is the first one aimed at the governance face rather than
the navigation face: corpus integrity, corpus-delta intent review, decision-bound constraints with
an enforcement-eligibility ledger, retrieval hit/miss evidence, derived-artifact equivalence
certification with a published scale envelope, measured standing surface cost, and a named
trust boundary for served content.

| `ground-generated-specs-in-the-graph` | resolve requirement→symbol citations against the graph |
| `harden-analyze-rebuild-atomicity` | The full edge-store rebuild is not atomic — concurrent readers see empty/partial/doubled graphs, and a >5s lock silently drops watcher work |
| `harden-bundle-import-trust` | integrity is not authenticity, and "verified current" must be earned |
| `harden-chat-agent-surface` | per-provider model resolution and honest terminal states |
| `harden-daemon-lifecycle` | protect the token, win the start race, drain before exit, bound the caches |
| `harden-grammar-load-disclosure` | A missing core-language grammar silently zeroes the whole language — disclose it, and stop the capability matrix over-claiming |
| `harden-llm-log-and-telemetry-honesty` | LLM logs persist full source always-on and unrotated; telemetry's kill-switch is inverted and its disclosure is narrower than what it records |
| `harden-llm-output-contract` | shape-check what you parse, disclose what you drop |
| `harden-llm-prompt-injection-boundary` | Untrusted repo content is instruction-level in every LLM prompt, and the agent-CLI providers run it tool-enabled |
| `harden-openspec-writer-fidelity` | The spec writer deletes human content on merge, discards validation results, and over-deletes domains that a filter never meant to remove |
| `harden-pi-config-and-daemon-fidelity` | The Pi extension clobbers governance config, blocks the first turn on an unbounded orient, and misdiagnoses a missing binary as "not analyzed" |
| `harden-review-render-and-action` | head-controlled text is hostile, and stale analysis must say so |
| `harden-spec-verification-honesty` | no silent decision loss, no shrinking denominator, no fabricated requirement claims |
| `harden-vector-index-coherence` | a rebuilt index must never be served through stale process caches |
| `harden-view-server-file-confinement` | The view server's file access is lexical-only — a symlink in a cloned repo escapes the project root; and it serves arbitrarily stale analysis as current |
| `optimize-incremental-and-coldstart-scale` | A branch switch grinds through the per-file incremental pipeline with no bulk fallback, reloading the full node table once per changed file |
| `optimize-serving-hot-path-caches` | The default tools rebuild derived graph structures and re-parse multi-MB artifacts on every call, and re-scan the whole corpus per keyword search |

Shipped and archived since: `refine-first-run-partial-serving` (2026-09-06) — an index-absent
first build now flushes a partial index and serves the repository structure and dependency graph
from it, with a completeness receipt attached at the dispatcher so every transport carries it,
negative conclusions withheld, and the published output still byte-identical to a single-write
build. Four rounds of adversarial review during the build also closed three PRE-EXISTING holes the
feature made reachable in the state where `.openlore/` is most likely to be adversarial (a freshly
cloned repo with no analysis): a named pipe under `.openlore/` could hang a tool call and stop the
server from exiting, the generation-manifest reads that verify every artifact were unbounded, and
a committed `.openlore/runtime` symlink redirected a recursive delete out of the repository.

Shipped and archived since: `disclose-dynamic-boundary-regions` (2026-09-06) — the call graph now
records every dispatch it cannot follow (reflection, computed members, `eval`, dynamic imports,
metaprogrammed definitions, DI resolution) as a **dynamic-boundary site**, and every conclusion whose
soundness rests on reachability discloses the sites inside the subgraph it traversed. `find_dead_code`
names the specific construct, `report_coverage_gaps` withholds `also-dead`, and `verify_claim` caps a
`dead`/`safe-to-change` verdict at `unverifiable` — disclosure only, never resolution, and never the
opposite conclusion. Four adversarial review rounds plus an end-to-end dogfood on three external
repositories found 19 defects during the build, the sharpest being a `moduleLevel` marker that was
false on 38% of sites and a retraction key that let an ordinary call erase a site outright.

Shipped and archived since: `resolve-literal-reflective-dispatch` (2026-09-12) — a stable
module-private JS/TS literal dispatch table (`HANDLERS[k]()`, `HANDLERS["create"]()`) now binds each
entry by its same-file declaration as a `literal-reflective` synthesized edge; every refusal stays a
disclosed dynamic-boundary site. Bound constructs are persisted separately so directly-resolved-only
conclusions still disclose them, a subset rebuild or an over-bound file binds nothing, and the watcher
re-derives rebuilt callers. Three rounds of four adversarial reviews re-scoped it twice: self-typed
receivers (`this["m"]()`, `getattr(self, "m")()`) were built and then removed because the class graph
cannot bound the receiver type soundly, and container resolution and Python dicts stay disclosed.

Shipped and archived since: `ground-generated-specs-in-the-graph` (2026-09-12, narrowed) — a pre-build
evidence audit found most of it superseded by the shipped deterministic spec link index, so it closes
the defects that remained: generated anchors are written below the normative text (the verifier no
longer describes a requirement by its anchor), requirements sharing an anchor key must agree or get
no anchor, and an anchor whose symbol is absent from a file the analysis cannot vouch for is
`not-assessed` with a named boundary (`language-not-extracted`, `file-not-analyzed`) instead of a false
`stale`, matched by the file's real spelling and re-assessed before a cached index is served. Two
review rounds withdrew `#### Requirement:` recovery (OpenSpec counts only `###`) and a parse-health
boundary (wrong extractor's evidence).

Shipped and archived since: `add-test-selection-safeguard-tiers` (2026-09-12, flakiness reader
deferred) — a diff's changed, added, and untracked test files are always selected beside the backward
walk, so a test-only diff no longer selects nothing. Every selection carries the `reason` behind its
served path and any other reasons, a path across synthesized edges carries a `structuralBasis`, and
`flakiness: { assessed: false }` is stated because no local per-test outcome history exists. Four
adversarial reviews fixed path frames for subdirectory analysis, over-broad test classification,
string-sorted depth reasons, cyclic `tested_by` paths, and an unbounded, silently failing untracked
listing (now capped at 200 with disclosure).

Shipped and archived since: `adopt-mcp-protocol-conformance` (2026-09-12, narrowed) — tool
annotations have no read-only fallback, and a TypeScript-checker trace from every dispatch branch to
write, spawn, and worker primitives fails CI when a read-only tool reaches a write outside a reasoned
allowlist. The audit corrected seven tools (two unlisted writers, `audit_spec_coverage` now dispatched
with `save: false`, destructive and open-world hints). Argument-validation failures are `isError`
results that name the parameter, the expected shape, and a schema-valid corrected call, bounded and
redacted. Output schemas (measured +19% to +96% of the substrate standing cost) and elicitation for
decision approval are deferred to their own changes.

Shipped and archived since: `add-framework-entry-point-adapters` (2026-09-12, narrowed) — deterministic
readers of the root package.json, tsconfig files, vitest/vite/jest setup files, and POSIX-shell GitHub
Actions `run:` steps make every function in a file a config executes an `externally-wired` liveness
root with a receipt, in `find_dead_code`, the shared dead set, `report_coverage_gaps`, and the
entry-point digest. A shell tokenizer counts only executed files (never arguments, redirects, or
heredoc bodies); variables, globs, `cd`, modules by name, PowerShell steps, and unreadable configs are
reasoned boundaries. Four adversarial reviews plus a fix-verification review hardened it against false
wiring, FIFO hangs, a YAML merge-key bomb, quadratic scans, and unbounded boundary growth. On this
repository 36 of 1,018 entry points are config-invoked.

Shipped and archived since: `refine-orient-context-budgeting` (2026-09-13, narrowed) — `orient`'s
`tokenBudget` fits the whole response as sent: the top-`limit` answer is built exactly as without a
budget, then functions ranked past `limit` are added with their call paths while they fit, or whole
lowest-ranked entries are trimmed peripheral-first with the fewest removals. Decisions, memories,
architecture violations, and matching specs are never dropped, and a `budget` receipt reports the exact
served size. Four adversarial reviews found the first version widened the pool before fitting (a
budget above the default returned less); two verification rounds hardened the redesign. Cold-start
expansion, seed shaping, and `get_minimal_context` are deferred.

Shipped and archived since: `add-merge-tree-conflict-oracle` (2026-09-13, narrowed) — every
`map_in_flight_conflicts` conflict pair carries a `textualMerge` verdict (`textual-conflict` with the
files named, `clean-automerge`, or `not-assessed` with a reason) from `git merge-tree` between the two
tip commits over a merge base resolved in the real repository. The merge runs in a scratch bare
repository that reads the real objects through an alternates file: a pre-build probe showed that
`merge-tree` writes objects and runs a repository-chosen merge driver (even from `info/attributes`,
past `--attr-source`), and the scratch repository prevents both. Four adversarial reviews added:
lazy fetch disabled (a partial clone's `uploadpack` command ran), merge attributes and
`merge.renormalize` checked in the real repository and rename settings forwarded (each gave a false
clean), `merge.default`, branch merge options, replace refs, and renames onto an attributed name
(three more false cleans in verification), merge drivers named like a default state and
subdirectory analysis roots (two more in a third round), then an allowlist for repository merge
settings plus `diff.algorithm` forwarding, decomposed-Unicode and case-variant attribute files, and
foreign `core.worktree` (five more in a fourth round), and a case check that always runs, reads config
with `-z`, and lists names literally (four more in a fifth round), non-ASCII names near changed paths and
empty config values read as false (two more in a sixth round), `merge.conflictStyle` forwarding
and `pull.twohead` (two more in a seventh round), and after a systematic pass over the config keys
`git merge` reads: `diff.algorithm` as `-X`, exact `pull.twohead`, strict value parsing, and `.git`
path components (four more in an eighth round), and untrimmed value parsing, value ranges, and git's
own path protection via `read-tree` (three more in a ninth round), an attribute allowlist plus git's
integer ranges (two more in a tenth round), attributes from the merged `.gitattributes` (one more in an
eleventh round), paths a directory rename places (one more in a twelfth round), submodule-to-file type changes
(one more in a fourteenth round), over-long paths (one more in a fifteenth round), over-long symlink targets (one more in a
sixteenth round), case-only file name collisions (one more in a seventeenth round), and refusing local rename and
diff-algorithm settings that a fresh clone or hosted merge would not carry (an eighteenth round), and
symlinked `.gitattributes` files (a nineteenth round), non-file modes, byte-order marks, and NUL
bytes in `.gitattributes` (a twentieth round), checkout attributes or near-limit lines in
`.gitattributes` itself (a twenty-first round), and tree attribute reads moved into the scratch repository
so a local `info/attributes` cannot hide a rule (a twenty-second round), submodule conflicts, a 20-second budget, and a
response-size loop. A missing or criss-cross
merge base, a PR head that is not local, an agent task, a cross-repo pair, or a cap is
`not-assessed`, never clean. Per-symbol hunk mapping is deferred.

Shipped and archived since: `refine-public-surface-certification` (2026-09-13, narrowed) —
`certify_public_surface` diff verdicts carry stable rule codes per change (`export-removed`,
`param-type-narrowed`, …, `signature-unprovable`, `export-added`) and a `suggestedBump`
(major/minor/patch as a total function of the classification). The eight breaking-classed codes are
registered findings (source `public-surface`) emitted in `findings[]`, so a policy gates individual
rules; `signature-unprovable` is never breaking-classed. The false "sibling repos are also checked"
disclosure now states in-repo only. The bump is withheld when compatibility is unproven, and `signature-unprovable` is a warning finding.
Deferred to `add-public-surface-acceptance-baseline`: the `--accept` baseline and the consumed/unconsumed
split with the federation consumer union. `openlore enforce` does not run the tool.

Shipped and archived since: `add-sarif-finding-emission` (2026-09-13, narrowed) — `openlore enforce
--sarif <path>` and `openlore review --sarif <path>` also write the classified governance findings as
a deterministic SARIF 2.1.0 log (every registered code as a rule; results with verbatim messages, a
fixed severity→level table, the enforcement class as a property, and an identity hash). A recorded
repository-relative location becomes a physical location; anything else is a logical location, never
a fabricated line. Printed output and exit codes are unchanged. Narrowed: no graph span lookup, no
per-rule `helpUri`, no vendored schema validator.

Shipped and archived since: `add-public-surface-acceptance-baseline` (2026-09-19, PR #519) —
`certify-public-surface --accept --justification` records intended breaking findings in
`.openlore/public-surface-baseline.jsonl`, keyed by rule code, subject, and a discriminator for the
exact break, so a later different break still reports; a decision-anchored acceptance expires when
the decision is superseded, and `.gitignore` is never edited (the command prints `git add -f`). Each
breaking change is split into `breaking-consumed` / `breaking-unconsumed-in-index` from resolved
calls, the dependency graph's imports (aliases, barrels, whole-module imports), and unresolved calls
to a removed name, with an opt-in federation census. Four review rounds (13 reviewers, 3 real-repo
dogfoods) closed about 30 defects. Two pre-existing classifier gaps (return-type direction; Python,
CommonJS, and positional-parameter false-safes) are filed as their own tasks.

Shipped and archived since: `add-symbol-content-hashes` (2026-09-19, PR #520) — `blast_radius`,
`select_tests` and `briefing_since` seed from the symbols a diff ACTUALLY changed, from normalized
per-symbol hashes taken over each changed file's parse tree at two revisions (comments dropped
except directives; tree shape kept, so Python indentation is structure). Module-level tokens, the
file's run layout, the per-import hashes and the module-level identifier names are four separate
signals, which is what keeps narrowing sound AND non-inert: an added symbol or a purely additive
name-binding import leaves the others alone, while an import that MOVES, a wildcard/blank/dot
import, or module-level code that NAMES a changed symbol keeps the whole file. Twelve closed
fallback reasons, four bounds (files, per-file bytes, total bytes, wall clock) that always degrade
toward seeding MORE, and a four-way claim (`unchanged` / `not-indexed` / `not-seeded` /
`not-assessed`) that refuses to say "nothing changed" when it means "not assessed". Five adversarial
review rounds (15 reviewers, ~35 defects) — the sharpest being a `git mv` that hashed identically
and dropped every symbol, a residual design that made narrowing inert (5–14x latency for ~0% gain),
an unbounded read phase (1.9 GB, fatal OOM), a FIFO that starved the libuv threadpool, and a
headline that kept rendering "formatting or comments only" after the caveat beside it was fixed.
Deferred: the persisted `norm_hash` column (to `add-incremental-early-cutoff`), the change-coupling
semantic-churn view, and `report_coverage_gaps`' diff scope.

Shipped and archived since: `add-perf-regression-counter-budgets` (2026-09-20, PR #524) —
CI-visible exact work budgets pin the shared source-parse boundary, native query compilation,
type inference, full EdgeStore loads and statement prepares, adjacency builds, and atomic artifact
payload bytes on fixed fixtures. The full-analysis, primed-orient, and 30-file incremental watcher
paths are exercised; an extra parse or full-table load fails its budget. Payload growth follows
the measured-delta ratchet policy in `docs/performance-budgets.md`.

## Maintenance rules (what kept this table honest)

- Ship a `change: <name>` marker in the code, or expect this table to call the change unbuilt.
- Never let a decision sync write a scenario-less requirement (see archived
  `2026-08-01-fix-decision-sync-template-validity`); `openspec validate --specs` must stay green.
- Archive promptly: a built change sitting open makes every count in this file wrong.
- Re-verify this file by re-running the evidence pass, not by trusting it.
