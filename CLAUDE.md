# spec-gen MCP tools — when to use them

| Situation | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Starting any new task | `orient` — returns functions, files, specs, call paths, and insertion points in one call |
| Don't know which file/function handles a concept | `search_code` |
| Need call topology across many files | `get_subgraph` / `analyze_impact` |
| Planning where to add a feature | `suggest_insertion_points` |
| Reading a spec before writing code | `get_spec` |
| Checking if code still matches spec | `check_spec_drift` |
| Finding spec requirements by meaning | `search_specs` |
| Checking spec coverage before starting a feature | `audit_spec_coverage` |

For all other cases (reading a file, grepping, listing files) use native tools directly.
