/**
 * Judge one Windows unit run against the tracked deny-list (issue #434).
 *
 * The `windows-unit` CI job runs the ENTIRE suite on windows-latest — nothing is filtered out — and
 * this script decides whether the result is acceptable, in both directions:
 *
 *   1. a failing file that is NOT on the list is a NEW Windows regression → fail;
 *   2. a listed file with zero failures has been fixed → fail, so the entry must be deleted.
 *
 * An entry marked `flaky: true` is exempt from BOTH rules and merely reported. A file that
 * oscillates run to run cannot satisfy either one — listed and passing trips rule 2, unlisted and
 * failing trips rule 1 — so without this a single unstable file would fail the build whichever way
 * it was recorded. The flag is a last resort, not a mute button: it demands observed evidence in
 * the entry's reason, it prints on every run, and it is tracked as a bug to fix.
 *
 * Rule 2 is what keeps the list a shrinking backlog rather than a permanent hole. Rule 1 is what
 * makes the job a real gate: without it, the deny-list would be the only thing under test.
 *
 * WHY ONE RUN RATHER THAN TWO. The first version of this ran the suite with the listed files
 * excluded, then re-ran just those files to see if any passed. The two runs disagreed on their very
 * first outing: `git-diff-corpus-materialization.test.ts` passed in the small re-run and failed in
 * the full one. A test's outcome can depend on what else is running beside it — temp directories,
 * worker concurrency, shared fixtures — so two runs in two contexts can each be right and still
 * contradict each other, leaving the job with no consistent verdict. Judging a single run removes
 * the contradiction by construction, and costs about a minute: the full suite takes ~7m against
 * ~6.5m for the filtered one, because the excluded files fail fast far more often than they hang.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/windows-unit-report.mjs <vitest-json-report>
